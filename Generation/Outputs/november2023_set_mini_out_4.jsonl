{"title": "David DePape found guilty in hammer attack on Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband", "text": "David DePape, the rightwing conspiracy theorist who attacked Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband in their San Francisco home, has been convicted of attempted kidnapping and assault. The federal jury\u2019s decision on Thursday comes after a dramatic trial in which Paul Pelosi testified about the \u201ctraumatic\u201d hammer attack he suffered on 28 October 2022, days before the midterm elections. DePape also took the stand in his defense, saying he had planned to interrogate the former House speaker and post footage of her online. The jury deliberated for about eight hours before finding DePape guilty of attempted kidnapping of a federal official and assault on the immediate family member of a federal official. DePape, who faces up to 50 years in prison, did not react as the verdict was read in court. Defense attorneys for DePape argued that he was caught up in conspiracy theories that influenced him to commit the crimes. DePape admitted in his own testimony during the trial that he broke into the Pelosis\u2019 house with a plan to hold the former House speaker hostage, and that he bludgeoned Paul Pelosi with a hammer after police officers showed up at the home. DePape, 43, echoed rightwing conspiracy theories and told jurors he had planned to wear an inflatable unicorn costume and record his interrogation of Nancy Pelosi to upload to the internet. Prosecutors say he had rope and zip ties with him. Detectives also found body cameras, a computer and a tablet. A sentencing date has not yet been set. At a news conference outside the federal courthouse where the verdict was read, the US attorney Ismail Ramsey told reporters: \u201cPeople can believe what they want and engage in passionate debate. But this guilty verdict on all counts sends a clear message that regardless of what your beliefs are, what you cannot do is physically attack a member of Congress or their immediate family for the performance of their job.\u201d  Prosecutors said that at the start of the attack at around 2am, DePape smashed through a door in the back of the Pelosis\u2019 house and encountered Paul Pelosi, then 82. He had been sleeping. DePape allegedly said: \u201cWhere\u2019s Nancy? Where\u2019s Nancy?\u201d as he stood over Paul Pelosi with zip ties and a hammer in his hands. Nancy Pelosi was in Washington DC during the break-in. Paul Pelosi managed to call police, and when two officers arrived, the officers saw DePape hit the speaker\u2019s husband in the head, which knocked him unconscious. Paul Pelosi was hospitalized with a skull fracture and injuries to his hands and arm. Part of the incident was captured on body-camera footage of police, and an FBI agent testified that the video indicated DePape hit him at least three times. \u201cIt was a tremendous shock to recognize that somebody had broken into the house and looking at him and looking at the hammer and the ties, I recognized that I was in serious danger, so I tried to stay as calm as possible,\u201d Paul Pelosi recounted to jurors. More than a year after the attack, Paul Pelosi said he still hadn\u2019t fully recovered. A neurosurgeon who operated on him testified that Pelosi had two wounds on his head, including a fracture to his skull that had to be mended with plates and screws he will have for the rest of his life. Pelosi also needed stitches on injuries to his right arm and hand, the surgeon said. DePape has a documented history of promoting conspiracy theories and far-right messages. On Facebook, he shared videos that falsely claimed the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump and misinformation about the January 6 insurrection. In court, DePape cried when he talked about his political beliefs, explaining how he came to support baseless narratives that a cabal of pedophiles were behind the US government. He also said he had wanted to talk to Nancy Pelosi about the 2016 election, and that he intended to question her while wearing an inflatable unicorn costume. \u201cHe was never my target and I\u2019m sorry that he got hurt,\u201d DePape said of Paul Pelosi. DePape and his attorneys did not deny he committed the attack. His lawyer, Jodi Linker, argued that he was not targeting Nancy Pelosi as retaliation for her official duties, but rather due to the conspiracy theories he believed \u201cwith every ounce of his body\u201d. In opening remarks, she said he was trying to stop the abuse of children and corruption: \u201cThis is not a whodunnit. But what the government fails to acknowledge is the \u2018whydunnit\u2019 \u2013 and the \u2018why\u2019 matters in this case.\u201d DePape is facing separate charges in state court, including attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, residential burglary and elderly abuse. He faces a potential life sentence in the state case and has pleaded not guilty, but that trial has not been set.", "summary": "Rightwing conspiracy theorist convicted of attempted kidnapping and assault in 2022 attack on Paul Pelosi", "authors": ["Sam Levin"], "publish_date": "11-16-2023", "status": "success", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/16/david-depape-guilty-paul-pelosi-trialn", "domain": "theguardian.com", "warc_date": "2023-11-16T16:01:03Z", "split": "gen", "inst_index": 83521, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["A private investigator who specialized in investigation of politicians in New Hampshire, the state capital, pleaded guilty yesterday to charges that he helped President Trump campaign officials avoid a bomb threat placed on staff on the day he was inaugurated.\nThe original charge against David DePape was based on his 1991 \u201cpleasure to go home\u201d plea to a misdemeanor charge of carrying a dangerous weapon, but the plea of not guilty was changed this week to second-degree murder.\nIn public view, DePape pleaded guilty in front of a Durham, New Hampshire judge, one day after authorities determined that he did not commit the deadly attack.\n\"I'm just glad he's not guilty,\" said Anthony Gallo, his partner in the case.\nOn the day of the first day of Trump\u2019s inauguration, a bomb threat appeared on the back of DePape\u2019s briefcase at a printing press plant. The presence of a bomb threatens to blow up the inauguration if not handled correctly, Prime Minister Theresa May declared.\nOutside the courtroom, many stood in protest over DePape\u2019s plea. Pamela Colvitto, a Democratic state senator and member of the Republican caucus, agreed.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this episode affects him deeply,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is the defendant in this case, but in terms of the truth, this prosecution is much better than the details.\u201d\nGregg Marcovich, a Democratic state senator from Beverly, told the Associated Press DePape should not be in prison.\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong to take away my greatest pleasure [when I heard about the scene]. He is on the forefront of our nation\u2019s intelligence community, and his career should be in service to the nation.\u201d\nDePape appeared at the downtown courtroom in an airplane cage, adorned with the red and white FBI logo and police lights. He notched a bushy mustache and appeared intently at one point to read a letter.\nDuring the plea hearing, a federal judge ordered DePape to undergo a psychological assessment, which will take place within the next few weeks.\n\u201cI regret I made a personal mistake,\u201d DePape wrote in his statement, according to the AP. \u201cI am remorseful and I accepted my responsibility.\u201d\nHe returned to work in September, about seven months before the election, and left as soon as he got home.\nAfter the attack, DePape said he was not consulted about the call.\n\"We were not told that the threat was warranted,\" the statement said. \"The (FBI) heads are looking into the situation and they want to know what happened to the threat.\"\nDePape surrendered at a news conference to investigators following an extensive investigation into his contacts with people on Capitol Hill and at Trump's events. Federal authorities said DePape did not breach a rules of engagement, which prohibited members of Congress and agents agents from contact with private citizens.\nIn their statement to the public, federal investigators said DePape asked the head of the FBI and Assistant Attorney General Robert Mueller to draft a tip sheet on a bomb threat. DePape answered the tip, but he did not call the FBI and prepare the FBI\u2019s assistance, the FBI said.\n\u201cThe threat wasn\u2019t fabricated, it was a threat of a possible terrorist attack,\u201d Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said in his statement.\nDespite the sketchy nature of the threat, the Justice Department stressed that it remained \u201cconcerned about the risks to homeland security posed by these threats.\u201d\n"], "gensraw_article": [[33, 2840, 20726, 509, 16977, 288, 3646, 287, 7603, 288, 969, 13911, 12, 263, 1182, 3140, 12, 16408, 6718, 7416, 285,

{"title": "US business elite welcomes Xi Jinping with standing ovation", "text": "Crowding into the Hyatt Regency to meet the Chinese leader were Elon Musk of Tesla, Tim Cook of Apple and Albert Bourla of Pfizer, all keen on selling more electric cars, iPhones and pharmaceuticals in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. After a day spent in long-awaited talks with US President Joe Biden, Xi told an audience of about 300 people: \u201cChina is both a super-large economy and a super-large market\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009modernisation for 1.4bn Chinese is a huge opportunity that China provides to the world.\u201d \u201cThe world needs China and the US to work together for a better future,\u201d he added. \u201cChina is ready to be a partner and friend of the US.\u201d The warm feelings appeared mutual. \u201cIf you go through the list of the top 20 US companies in China, they were all there,\u201d said one San Francisco tech titan who attended the event but did not want his name to be published. On his way into the Hyatt, Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio told the Financial Times he was \u201cexcited to have this relationship [with Xi]\u201d. But while Xi made an effort to express his country\u2019s open welcome to US business, a combination of whipsawing tensions with Washington, a rocky economic recovery from the pandemic and Beijing\u2019s increasingly assertive domestic security apparatus has damped enthusiasm among American investors for making big bets on China. A series of US companies have begun packing up their bags or rerouting supply chains out of fear that geopolitical tensions could disrupt business. Technology groups such as Airbnb and LinkedIn have retreated from the country, as have consulting firms Gallup and Forrester Research. Even Apple, which has long relied on Chinese manufacturing, has begun sourcing orders in countries such as India and Vietnam. Business leaders and analysts said they did not expect Xi\u2019s summit with Biden to fully thaw relations. The two presidents agreed to restart military communications and set up a counter-narcotics working group to tackle fentanyl pouring into the US, but they left with several issues unresolved, most notably tensions over Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory. Myron Brilliant, former head of international relations for the US Chamber of Commerce, said while Chinese officials were reverting to the playbook of courting the business community for investment and to help manage ties with Washington, \u201ctimes have changed\u201d. \u201cBottom line is that American business leaders don\u2019t want to be caught in a game of chess between China and the US governments,\u201d said Brilliant. \u201cCEOs are risk-averse\u2009[and] the environment between China and the US has increased the risk of doing business in China.\u201d Increasingly vocal criticism of China by hawkish US politicians has further complicated a fraught environment for business leaders. On Tuesday, Mike Gallagher, chair of the House of Representatives\u2019 China committee, called it \u201cunconscionable\u201d that US executives were paying to attend the dinner with Xi, citing Beijing\u2019s repression of Muslim Uyghurs in China\u2019s north-western Xinjiang region and demanding a list of attendees. A Chinese-US executive at a tech company that straddles both countries told the FT that his attendance was a \u201cstate secret\u201d. Darren Woods, chief executive of ExxonMobil, which is in the process of building a multibillion-dollar petrochemical plant in southern China, told reporters on Wednesday morning that he would not attend the dinner. \u201cChinese and the US government relationships are going to kind of ebb and flow with time,\u201d Woods said. \u201cBoth countries are too important to the global world order to not find some balance, although that balance will shift.\u201d Shi Yinhong, an expert on US-China relations at Renmin University of China, said both governments\u2019 preoccupation with national security would set a ceiling on relations. \u201cIf economic interests conflict with national security, national security will undoubtedly take precedence,\u201d said Shi. China\u2019s increasingly forceful domestic security apparatus has unnerved many foreign businesses, conducting raids on US consultancy Bain & Co and detaining five local employees at due diligence group Mintz. Beijing has also banned the use of US group Micron\u2019s chips in critical infrastructure over cyber security risks. Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said Beijing\u2019s scrutiny of US businesses in the country was sending \u201cmixed messages\u201d and he hoped Xi\u2019s friendly rhetoric would trickle down through the bureaucracy. Given the uncertain trajectory for China\u2019s economy, which has been hit by a sluggish property sector and weak exports, Hart added that some US groups remained pessimistic. China has struggled to kick-start strong growth since lifting pandemic controls this year. But he said for many companies, \u201cChina is still an important market and profitable\u201d. Beijing \u201crealises that the private sector is getting quite nervous\u201d, said Emily Kilcrease, a technology expert at the CNAS think-tank. While Xi sought to reassure US businesses at the dinner, unless Beijing eases pressure on US multinationals and ceases imposing exit bans on foreign executives, \u201cthose concerns from the private sector will continue to persist despite the rhetoric\u201d, she added. Xi told business leaders in San Francisco: \u201cThe number one question for us is, are we adversaries or partners?\u201d If the US and China saw each other as rivals, he warned, \u201cit will only lead to misinformed policymaking, misguided actions and unwanted results\u201d.", "summary": "China\u2019s president projects friendly tone but analysts say increasing scrutiny has rattled foreign groups", "authors": ["Ryan McMorrow and Demetri Sevastopulo"], "publish_date": "11-15-2023", "status": "success", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a8633d7f-f785-4195-b0b2-0ea9506968c9", "domain": "ft.com", "warc_date": "2023-11-16T16:14:03Z", "split": "gen", "inst_index": 92751, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\nState-backed officials from Xi Jinping\u2019s \u201cnew nation\u201d China came together for a robust discussion on Friday, in a carefully staged display of cohesion that invited President Trump to take his lead and accept a warm welcome from the nation\u2019s business elite.\nXi\u2019s entourage, including a Chinese leadership team, met immediately after they returned from a five-day state visit to the US. Standing on the sidelines was a team of eight ministers, including party secretaries, front-office officials and Chinese leaders.\nSignalling China\u2019s continued economic assertiveness and its commitment to the rule of law, Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks to the media at a session to mark the group\u2019s 54th anniversary, the occasion not decided by any particular party or state, but by the \u201cnew nation\u201d Xi was speaking about, in a joint session with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\nHowever, in a sign of how far into the year the propaganda war over the currency has taken a back seat to Trump, the US President\u2019s team was dismayed when they refused to meet with him after he rejected his previous request to meet with outgoing US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.\n\u201cI have been an enthusiastic supporter of our partnership, despite the fact that many of its priorities still run in China\u2019s direction,\u201d President Xi said in a statement, adding that: \u201cI appreciate that the country has certain reasons for respecting the direct interactions we have had. The speed with which its foreign relations are emerging from administration has been a blessing in disguise.\u201d\nIn a thinly veiled swipe at Trump, President Xi Jinping said in Beijing that China was ending its trade deficit with the US and working on open trade links with other nations.\n\u201cNegotiations on trade will be formalised in March, with soft bilateral action,\u201d he said. \u201cAll export agreements will be cancelled as soon as possible, save for those that prove necessary.\u201d\nThe US Treasury last week cut further to Mr Trump\u2019s $1tn trade deficit with China, over the span of the current year. By January 2023, it expects the current account deficit will reach $US19 trillion. The world\u2019s second largest economy has developed a strategy of avoiding higher commodity prices and exporting raw materials in search of higher profits.\n\u201cYou are in the wilderness without high expectations,\u201d Mr Trump said to the joint meeting. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to be forgotten unless you raise your prices.\n\u201cChina has a very high standard of consumer hygiene, and their nation-ownership of their raw materials is using them like crude oil to sell to their southern neighbours \u2013 the engines of China.\u201d\n"], "gensraw_article": [[2062, 374, 2985, 31187,
