{"title": "David DePape found guilty in hammer attack on Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband", "text": "David DePape, the rightwing conspiracy theorist who attacked Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband in their San Francisco home, has been convicted of attempted kidnapping and assault. The federal jury\u2019s decision on Thursday comes after a dramatic trial in which Paul Pelosi testified about the \u201ctraumatic\u201d hammer attack he suffered on 28 October 2022, days before the midterm elections. DePape also took the stand in his defense, saying he had planned to interrogate the former House speaker and post footage of her online. The jury deliberated for about eight hours before finding DePape guilty of attempted kidnapping of a federal official and assault on the immediate family member of a federal official. DePape, who faces up to 50 years in prison, did not react as the verdict was read in court. Defense attorneys for DePape argued that he was caught up in conspiracy theories that influenced him to commit the crimes. DePape admitted in his own testimony during the trial that he broke into the Pelosis\u2019 house with a plan to hold the former House speaker hostage, and that he bludgeoned Paul Pelosi with a hammer after police officers showed up at the home. DePape, 43, echoed rightwing conspiracy theories and told jurors he had planned to wear an inflatable unicorn costume and record his interrogation of Nancy Pelosi to upload to the internet. Prosecutors say he had rope and zip ties with him. Detectives also found body cameras, a computer and a tablet. A sentencing date has not yet been set. At a news conference outside the federal courthouse where the verdict was read, the US attorney Ismail Ramsey told reporters: \u201cPeople can believe what they want and engage in passionate debate. But this guilty verdict on all counts sends a clear message that regardless of what your beliefs are, what you cannot do is physically attack a member of Congress or their immediate family for the performance of their job.\u201d  Prosecutors said that at the start of the attack at around 2am, DePape smashed through a door in the back of the Pelosis\u2019 house and encountered Paul Pelosi, then 82. He had been sleeping. DePape allegedly said: \u201cWhere\u2019s Nancy? Where\u2019s Nancy?\u201d as he stood over Paul Pelosi with zip ties and a hammer in his hands. Nancy Pelosi was in Washington DC during the break-in. Paul Pelosi managed to call police, and when two officers arrived, the officers saw DePape hit the speaker\u2019s husband in the head, which knocked him unconscious. Paul Pelosi was hospitalized with a skull fracture and injuries to his hands and arm. Part of the incident was captured on body-camera footage of police, and an FBI agent testified that the video indicated DePape hit him at least three times. \u201cIt was a tremendous shock to recognize that somebody had broken into the house and looking at him and looking at the hammer and the ties, I recognized that I was in serious danger, so I tried to stay as calm as possible,\u201d Paul Pelosi recounted to jurors. More than a year after the attack, Paul Pelosi said he still hadn\u2019t fully recovered. A neurosurgeon who operated on him testified that Pelosi had two wounds on his head, including a fracture to his skull that had to be mended with plates and screws he will have for the rest of his life. Pelosi also needed stitches on injuries to his right arm and hand, the surgeon said. DePape has a documented history of promoting conspiracy theories and far-right messages. On Facebook, he shared videos that falsely claimed the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump and misinformation about the January 6 insurrection. In court, DePape cried when he talked about his political beliefs, explaining how he came to support baseless narratives that a cabal of pedophiles were behind the US government. He also said he had wanted to talk to Nancy Pelosi about the 2016 election, and that he intended to question her while wearing an inflatable unicorn costume. \u201cHe was never my target and I\u2019m sorry that he got hurt,\u201d DePape said of Paul Pelosi. DePape and his attorneys did not deny he committed the attack. His lawyer, Jodi Linker, argued that he was not targeting Nancy Pelosi as retaliation for her official duties, but rather due to the conspiracy theories he believed \u201cwith every ounce of his body\u201d. In opening remarks, she said he was trying to stop the abuse of children and corruption: \u201cThis is not a whodunnit. But what the government fails to acknowledge is the \u2018whydunnit\u2019 \u2013 and the \u2018why\u2019 matters in this case.\u201d DePape is facing separate charges in state court, including attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, residential burglary and elderly abuse. He faces a potential life sentence in the state case and has pleaded not guilty, but that trial has not been set.", "summary": "Rightwing conspiracy theorist convicted of attempted kidnapping and assault in 2022 attack on Paul Pelosi", "authors": ["Sam Levin"], "publish_date": "11-16-2023", "status": "success", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/16/david-depape-guilty-paul-pelosi-trialn", "domain": "theguardian.com", "warc_date": "2023-11-16T16:01:03Z", "split": "gen", "inst_index": 83521, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["30-year-old was found guilty of assault and grand theft charges in his attack on former US representative Harold Ford, husband of House minority leader Nancy Pelosi\nA young man who became a national figure after ramming a hammer into the home of the late politician Harold Ford during an attempted robbery was found guilty on Monday of assault and grand theft charges.\nDavid DePape, 30, used a hammer to destroy part of the former congressman\u2019s home and tried to steal several items, including his ATM card, his expensive green Cadillac Escalade, valued at more than $150,000 and other valuables.\nAccording to prosecutors, the hammer attack led to fears for Ford\u2019s family and worried neighbors.\nThe court heard that his mother phoned 911 when she came home to discover the damage at Ford\u2019s home in San Diego.\nA jury took less than two hours to find DePape guilty of six of 11 felony charges: assault with a deadly weapon, burglary, grand theft, auto theft, vandalism, and two counts of possession of burglar tools.\nIn May 2011, dePape was arrested just blocks from Ford\u2019s home, which was adjacent to his mother\u2019s house. He had been held for about a week and during that time, he was observed wandering about the crime scene in a distressed state, according to witnesses who called 911.\nThe witness saw dePape crying and moaning at Ford\u2019s house and in the neighborhood where a neighbor described feeling scared and \u201cunsafe\u201d.\nIn a tearful call, dePape\u2019s mother said she \u201ccannot believe my son has the temerity to do this to Harold and his mother and everybody else around him\u201d. She added: \u201cI just can\u2019t believe they have their doors locked now.\u201d\nIn a sometimes-testy five-day trial, dePape wore glasses, a full beard and a T-shirt under a blue suit. DePape\u2019s attorney told jurors that their decision to convict dePape would only \u201cmake things worse\u201d.\nFord did not testify at the trial.\nProsecutors presented evidence that DePape had gone to Ford\u2019s house with plans to rob him of valuables. Two days before his arrest, dePape bragged to his friend that he \u201cgot to work\u201d, according to a witness.\nDuring the attack, Ford was spotted standing outside his SUV when it was struck by a car he had recently stolen, prosecutors said. An auto mechanic whose shop is next to Ford\u2019s home testified that it was like a \u201cmeltdown\u201d when he first saw the damage: \u201cThis is the house of a wealthy guy, I can\u2019t believe this has happened,\u201d he told the court.\nAt one point, the same mechanic had to clear away a window to get to Ford, who was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat when the incident took place.\nCourt documents said the Pontiac Bonneville was stolen from a retail store in Carlsbad, California, hours before the hammer attack.\nDePape, who was hired to work as a housekeeper in Ford\u2019s mansion, was suspended without pay by his employer after his arrest. He was found guilty on one charge of grand theft auto after fleeing from the scene of the crime.\nFord left his politics in 1992 and worked as a movie studio executive until 2005. In 2008, he was elected to the US Senate, but lost his re-election bid in 2010. He died in 2012 after battling prostate cancer.\nFederal agents had originally investigated dePape as a possible conspiracy ringleader, but his case went ahead in local court as part of a larger investigation into the grisly 2011 torture and killing of the couple James and Shannon Gohmert.\n"], "gensraw_article": [[1271, 13, 1942, 13, 728, 374, 1044, 6718, 287, 4642, 291, 4491, 12403, 4531,

{"title": "US business elite welcomes Xi Jinping with standing ovation", "text": "Crowding into the Hyatt Regency to meet the Chinese leader were Elon Musk of Tesla, Tim Cook of Apple and Albert Bourla of Pfizer, all keen on selling more electric cars, iPhones and pharmaceuticals in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. After a day spent in long-awaited talks with US President Joe Biden, Xi told an audience of about 300 people: \u201cChina is both a super-large economy and a super-large market\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009modernisation for 1.4bn Chinese is a huge opportunity that China provides to the world.\u201d \u201cThe world needs China and the US to work together for a better future,\u201d he added. \u201cChina is ready to be a partner and friend of the US.\u201d The warm feelings appeared mutual. \u201cIf you go through the list of the top 20 US companies in China, they were all there,\u201d said one San Francisco tech titan who attended the event but did not want his name to be published. On his way into the Hyatt, Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio told the Financial Times he was \u201cexcited to have this relationship [with Xi]\u201d. But while Xi made an effort to express his country\u2019s open welcome to US business, a combination of whipsawing tensions with Washington, a rocky economic recovery from the pandemic and Beijing\u2019s increasingly assertive domestic security apparatus has damped enthusiasm among American investors for making big bets on China. A series of US companies have begun packing up their bags or rerouting supply chains out of fear that geopolitical tensions could disrupt business. Technology groups such as Airbnb and LinkedIn have retreated from the country, as have consulting firms Gallup and Forrester Research. Even Apple, which has long relied on Chinese manufacturing, has begun sourcing orders in countries such as India and Vietnam. Business leaders and analysts said they did not expect Xi\u2019s summit with Biden to fully thaw relations. The two presidents agreed to restart military communications and set up a counter-narcotics working group to tackle fentanyl pouring into the US, but they left with several issues unresolved, most notably tensions over Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory. Myron Brilliant, former head of international relations for the US Chamber of Commerce, said while Chinese officials were reverting to the playbook of courting the business community for investment and to help manage ties with Washington, \u201ctimes have changed\u201d. \u201cBottom line is that American business leaders don\u2019t want to be caught in a game of chess between China and the US governments,\u201d said Brilliant. \u201cCEOs are risk-averse\u2009[and] the environment between China and the US has increased the risk of doing business in China.\u201d Increasingly vocal criticism of China by hawkish US politicians has further complicated a fraught environment for business leaders. On Tuesday, Mike Gallagher, chair of the House of Representatives\u2019 China committee, called it \u201cunconscionable\u201d that US executives were paying to attend the dinner with Xi, citing Beijing\u2019s repression of Muslim Uyghurs in China\u2019s north-western Xinjiang region and demanding a list of attendees. A Chinese-US executive at a tech company that straddles both countries told the FT that his attendance was a \u201cstate secret\u201d. Darren Woods, chief executive of ExxonMobil, which is in the process of building a multibillion-dollar petrochemical plant in southern China, told reporters on Wednesday morning that he would not attend the dinner. \u201cChinese and the US government relationships are going to kind of ebb and flow with time,\u201d Woods said. \u201cBoth countries are too important to the global world order to not find some balance, although that balance will shift.\u201d Shi Yinhong, an expert on US-China relations at Renmin University of China, said both governments\u2019 preoccupation with national security would set a ceiling on relations. \u201cIf economic interests conflict with national security, national security will undoubtedly take precedence,\u201d said Shi. China\u2019s increasingly forceful domestic security apparatus has unnerved many foreign businesses, conducting raids on US consultancy Bain & Co and detaining five local employees at due diligence group Mintz. Beijing has also banned the use of US group Micron\u2019s chips in critical infrastructure over cyber security risks. Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said Beijing\u2019s scrutiny of US businesses in the country was sending \u201cmixed messages\u201d and he hoped Xi\u2019s friendly rhetoric would trickle down through the bureaucracy. Given the uncertain trajectory for China\u2019s economy, which has been hit by a sluggish property sector and weak exports, Hart added that some US groups remained pessimistic. China has struggled to kick-start strong growth since lifting pandemic controls this year. But he said for many companies, \u201cChina is still an important market and profitable\u201d. Beijing \u201crealises that the private sector is getting quite nervous\u201d, said Emily Kilcrease, a technology expert at the CNAS think-tank. While Xi sought to reassure US businesses at the dinner, unless Beijing eases pressure on US multinationals and ceases imposing exit bans on foreign executives, \u201cthose concerns from the private sector will continue to persist despite the rhetoric\u201d, she added. Xi told business leaders in San Francisco: \u201cThe number one question for us is, are we adversaries or partners?\u201d If the US and China saw each other as rivals, he warned, \u201cit will only lead to misinformed policymaking, misguided actions and unwanted results\u201d.", "summary": "China\u2019s president projects friendly tone but analysts say increasing scrutiny has rattled foreign groups", "authors": ["Ryan McMorrow and Demetri Sevastopulo"], "publish_date": "11-15-2023", "status": "success", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a8633d7f-f785-4195-b0b2-0ea9506968c9", "domain": "ft.com", "warc_date": "2023-11-16T16:14:03Z", "split": "gen", "inst_index": 92751, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["Thank you for your help!\nWhat was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\nPresident Xi Jinping took the stage on Tuesday night at the Wall Street Journal Dealmakers conference in New York to an enthusiastic standing ovation, during his keynote address to US corporate executives from banks, brokerages and investment firms.\nA number of people who watched the whole speech, recorded at the Manhattan offices of Goldman Sachs, said Mr Xi was able to keep the audience members on their feet.\n\u201cHe had that magic touch. There was not much that could go wrong in the speech,\u201d said a senior banker.\nThe evening\u2019s repertoire of quotations included a quotation from Confucius, which Mr Xi used to stress the importance of strategic plans and organisation, saying: \u201cLet us unite our mind, our efforts and our capabilities.\u201d He spoke to the potential of blockchain technology.\nAt another point, Mr Xi, who is Communist party secretary of China and head of the powerful Politburo Standing Committee, told US business leaders that \u201ca win-win outcome is never over\u201d.\n\u201cSome reports mention that our US business visitors have expressed concern about the trade war,\u201d Mr Xi said, according to the Wall Street Journal, which was moderating the event. \u201cThey point out the impact on US business. As a Communist party secretary, I can say, the results of any battles must be in the interests of the masses.\u201d\nEarlier, people who had been attending said that Mr Xi\u2019s warm introduction and \u201cstate welcome\u201d was followed by a reception that lasted some three hours.\n\u201cThere was an appreciation of who President Xi is,\u201d one banker said. \u201cI felt like there was a little less pressure.\u201d\n\u201cAt the end of the reception, there was another ballroom filled with guest from around the world,\u201d said a senior banker. \u201cIt was an impressive turnout.\u201d\nIn his speech, Mr Xi made clear he would continue pursuing one of the most sweeping economic reforms initiated by late president Deng Xiaoping in 1978, putting power in the hands of the people to give them a say in decision-making. Mr Xi said that this was the best guarantee of the party\u2019s power and continued prosperity for the Chinese people.\nAccording to analysts, Xi Jinping might have touched on some of the most sensitive subject matter in the US, such as the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision to allow a president to select US district judges. He said China would strive to ensure that it can \u201ccontinue to preserve the world\u2019s good reputation.\u201d\n\u201cChina would not stand to welcome troubles and setbacks in the region or the world for its own sake,\u201d Mr Xi said. \u201cIt has the honour and deep responsibility to lead and promote the rule of law.\u201d\nOther key quotes from Xi Jinping\u2019s keynote speech to the WSJ
