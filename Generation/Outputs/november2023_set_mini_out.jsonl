{"title": "David DePape found guilty in hammer attack on Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband", "text": "David DePape, the rightwing conspiracy theorist who attacked Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband in their San Francisco home, has been convicted of attempted kidnapping and assault. The federal jury\u2019s decision on Thursday comes after a dramatic trial in which Paul Pelosi testified about the \u201ctraumatic\u201d hammer attack he suffered on 28 October 2022, days before the midterm elections. DePape also took the stand in his defense, saying he had planned to interrogate the former House speaker and post footage of her online. The jury deliberated for about eight hours before finding DePape guilty of attempted kidnapping of a federal official and assault on the immediate family member of a federal official. DePape, who faces up to 50 years in prison, did not react as the verdict was read in court. Defense attorneys for DePape argued that he was caught up in conspiracy theories that influenced him to commit the crimes. DePape admitted in his own testimony during the trial that he broke into the Pelosis\u2019 house with a plan to hold the former House speaker hostage, and that he bludgeoned Paul Pelosi with a hammer after police officers showed up at the home. DePape, 43, echoed rightwing conspiracy theories and told jurors he had planned to wear an inflatable unicorn costume and record his interrogation of Nancy Pelosi to upload to the internet. Prosecutors say he had rope and zip ties with him. Detectives also found body cameras, a computer and a tablet. A sentencing date has not yet been set. At a news conference outside the federal courthouse where the verdict was read, the US attorney Ismail Ramsey told reporters: \u201cPeople can believe what they want and engage in passionate debate. But this guilty verdict on all counts sends a clear message that regardless of what your beliefs are, what you cannot do is physically attack a member of Congress or their immediate family for the performance of their job.\u201d  Prosecutors said that at the start of the attack at around 2am, DePape smashed through a door in the back of the Pelosis\u2019 house and encountered Paul Pelosi, then 82. He had been sleeping. DePape allegedly said: \u201cWhere\u2019s Nancy? Where\u2019s Nancy?\u201d as he stood over Paul Pelosi with zip ties and a hammer in his hands. Nancy Pelosi was in Washington DC during the break-in. Paul Pelosi managed to call police, and when two officers arrived, the officers saw DePape hit the speaker\u2019s husband in the head, which knocked him unconscious. Paul Pelosi was hospitalized with a skull fracture and injuries to his hands and arm. Part of the incident was captured on body-camera footage of police, and an FBI agent testified that the video indicated DePape hit him at least three times. \u201cIt was a tremendous shock to recognize that somebody had broken into the house and looking at him and looking at the hammer and the ties, I recognized that I was in serious danger, so I tried to stay as calm as possible,\u201d Paul Pelosi recounted to jurors. More than a year after the attack, Paul Pelosi said he still hadn\u2019t fully recovered. A neurosurgeon who operated on him testified that Pelosi had two wounds on his head, including a fracture to his skull that had to be mended with plates and screws he will have for the rest of his life. Pelosi also needed stitches on injuries to his right arm and hand, the surgeon said. DePape has a documented history of promoting conspiracy theories and far-right messages. On Facebook, he shared videos that falsely claimed the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump and misinformation about the January 6 insurrection. In court, DePape cried when he talked about his political beliefs, explaining how he came to support baseless narratives that a cabal of pedophiles were behind the US government. He also said he had wanted to talk to Nancy Pelosi about the 2016 election, and that he intended to question her while wearing an inflatable unicorn costume. \u201cHe was never my target and I\u2019m sorry that he got hurt,\u201d DePape said of Paul Pelosi. DePape and his attorneys did not deny he committed the attack. His lawyer, Jodi Linker, argued that he was not targeting Nancy Pelosi as retaliation for her official duties, but rather due to the conspiracy theories he believed \u201cwith every ounce of his body\u201d. In opening remarks, she said he was trying to stop the abuse of children and corruption: \u201cThis is not a whodunnit. But what the government fails to acknowledge is the \u2018whydunnit\u2019 \u2013 and the \u2018why\u2019 matters in this case.\u201d DePape is facing separate charges in state court, including attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, residential burglary and elderly abuse. He faces a potential life sentence in the state case and has pleaded not guilty, but that trial has not been set.", "summary": "Rightwing conspiracy theorist convicted of attempted kidnapping and assault in 2022 attack on Paul Pelosi", "authors": ["Sam Levin"], "publish_date": "11-16-2023", "status": "success", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/16/david-depape-guilty-paul-pelosi-trialn", "domain": "theguardian.com", "warc_date": "2023-11-16T16:01:03Z", "split": "gen", "inst_index": 83521, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["One-time Democrat appointee David DePape was found guilty in his own commission of hitting his wife Nancy Pelosi with a hammer during an unprovoked attack. Photo by -David DePape/Files\nIt took a year for David DePape, the Democrat appointee to the Democratic National Committee, to be found guilty of assault in the case of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband, David DePape. DePape has been indicted in his own commission of hitting his wife Nancy Pelosi with a hammer during an unprovoked attack.\nDavid DePape was one of several Democrats charged in a Federal Election Commission complaint earlier this year with assault after Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democratic party, accused him of leaving her keys in the mailbox. The complaint and subsequent trial put on hold, citing procedural issues surrounding the dePape case.\nWhile the arrest of the dePape alleged in the complaint was a turning point for the prosecution, a further testimony in the indictment by the federal prosecutors \u2014 both for the assault and for his role in it \u2014 is sure to raise questions about the charges.\nThe District attorney\u2019s office declined to comment on the indictments.\nDavid DePape, who the federal prosecutors say committed the assault, had waited nearly 30 years for justice and came to Washington roughly five years ago to pick up the tab for the nearly $600,000 she owes him for imputing legal fees for all the \u201cpolitical shenanigans\u201d over his handling of dePape\u2019s case.\n\u201cHe felt compelled to stay on the case and by the end of the year, was both involved in and involved in many more cases,\u201d his chief of staff, Catherine Bruni, told CBS News.\nSoon after the indictment, dePape accepted an offer to plead guilty to the charge, and offered to cooperate with the investigation.\nAlong with not apologizing, he promised to cooperate with every effort it took to get him on the front pages of news outlets, including The Washington Post, to answer his accusers. \u201cI never used a hammer, and I\u2019m not scared of that anymore,\u201d he said, according to the Post.\nBut he has been questioned by U.S. prosecutors about whether his departure was a sign of changing his stance on a new Russian campaign against the Democrats.\nAlso believed to be part of the conversation was an uptick in Pelosi\u2019s popularity, and the number of news media articles critical of her \u2014 largely since a 2014 report by journalist Robert Novak \u2014 which seem to run like summer break.\nDPA has questioned whether or not the FBI would have prosecuted David DePape if it had known about his arrest. Interviews with four Democrats who worked for Pelosi were also subpoenaed.\n"], "gensraw_article": [[3199, 13, 2436, 9756, 5394, 1454, 3272, 1025, 48, 1759, 374, 1044, 6718, 288, 466, 899, 5811, 287,
