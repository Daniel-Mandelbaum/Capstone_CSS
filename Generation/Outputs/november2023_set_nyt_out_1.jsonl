{"title": "Nikki Haley Is Coming for Your Retirement", "text": "It feels like years ago, but actually only a few months have passed since many big Republican donors seemed to believe that Ron DeSantis could effectively challenge Donald Trump for the Republican nomination. It has been an edifying spectacle \u2014 an object lesson in the reality that great wealth need not be associated with good judgment, about politics or anything else. At this point, both conventional wisdom and prediction markets say that Trump has a virtual lock on the nomination. But Wall Street isn\u2019t completely resigned to Trump\u2019s inevitability; there has been a late surge in big-money support for Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina. And there is, to be fair, still a chance that Trump \u2014 who is facing many criminal charges and whose public rants have become utterly unhinged \u2014 will manage to crash and burn before securing the nomination. So it seems worth looking at what Haley stands for. From a political point of view, one answer might be: nothing. A recent Times profile described her as having \u201can ability to calibrate her message to the moment.\u201d A less euphemistic way to put this is that she seems willing to say whatever might work to her political advantage. \u201cFlip-flopping\u201d doesn\u2019t really convey the sheer cynicism with which she has shifted her rhetoric and changed her positions on everything from abortion rights to immigration to whether it\u2019s OK to try overturning a national election. And anyone hoping that she would govern as a moderate if she should somehow make it to the White House is surely delusional. Haley has never really shown a willingness to stand up to Republican extremists \u2014 and at this point the whole G.O.P. has been taken over by extremists. That said, Haley has shown some consistency on issues of economic and fiscal policy. And what you should know is that her positions on these issues are pretty far to the right. In particular, she seems exceptionally explicit, even among would-be Republican nominees, in calling for an increase in the age at which Americans become eligible for Social Security \u2014 a bad idea that seems to be experiencing a revival. So let\u2019s talk about Social Security. The first thing you should know about Social Security is that the actual numbers don\u2019t justify the apocalyptic rhetoric one often hears, not just from the right but from self-proclaimed centrists who want to sound serious. No, the exhaustion of the system\u2019s trust fund, currently projected to occur in roughly a decade, wouldn\u2019t mean that benefits disappear. It would mean that the system would need additional revenue to continue paying scheduled benefits in full. But the extra revenue required would be smaller than you probably think. The most recent long-term projections from the Congressional Budget Office show Social Security outlays rising to 6.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2053 from 5.1 percent this year, not exactly an earth-shattering increase. It\u2019s true that the budget office projects a much bigger rise in spending on Medicare and other major health programs. But much of this projected rise reflects the assumption that medical costs will rise much faster than economic growth, which has been true in the past but need not be true in the future. Indeed, since 2010, Medicare spending has been far less than expected. And there is every reason to believe that smart policies could further curb health care costs, given how much more America spends than other wealthy nations. Still, Social Security does face a funding gap. How should it be closed? Anyone who says, as Haley does, that the retirement age should rise in line with increasing life expectancy is being oblivious, perhaps willfully, to the grim inequality of modern America. Until Covid struck, average life expectancy at 65, the relevant number, was indeed rising. But these gains were concentrated among Americans with relatively high incomes. Less affluent Americans \u2014 those who depend most on Social Security \u2014 have seen little rise in life expectancy, and in some cases actual declines. So anyone invoking rising life expectancy as a reason to delay Social Security benefits is, in effect, saying that aging janitors must keep working (or be cast into extreme poverty) because bankers are living longer. How, then, should the Social Security gap be closed? The obvious answer \u2014 which happens to be favored by a majority of voters \u2014 is to raise more revenue. Remember, America collects less revenue as a percentage of G.D.P. than almost any other advanced economy. But Haley, of course, wants to cut income taxes. My guess is that none of this will be relevant, that Trump will be the nominee. But if he stumbles, I would beg political reporters not to focus on Haley\u2019s personal affect, which can seem moderate, but rather on her policies. On social issues and the fate of democracy, she appears to be a pure weather vane, turning with the political winds. On fiscal and economic policy, she\u2019s a hard-right advocate of tax cuts for the rich and benefit cuts for the working class. If calling someone a \u201cpopulist\u201d has any meaning these days, she\u2019s the exact opposite.", "summary": "Nikki Haley Is Coming for Your Retirement", "authors": ["Paul Krugman"], "publish_date": "11-27-2023", "status": "success", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/27/opinion/nikki-haley-social-security.html", "domain": "nytimes.com", "warc_date": "2023-11-27T20:00:00Z", "split": "gen", "inst_index": 6, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["Photo\nI can\u2019t tell you how thrilling it is to watch someone who so completely understands the Trump regime\u2019s policies \u2014 and how destructive those policies are \u2014 get down to business,\nYes, yes, I know that John Kerry didn\u2019t quite say all of this.

{"title": "Former Coal Towns Get Money for Clean-Energy Factories", "text": "In Weirton, W.Va., in the heart of coal country, a company started by MIT scientists plans to build a plant that will produce a metal and alloy critical for clean energy, fuel cells and cleaner steel. In Vernon, Texas, also a former coal town, a third-generation wind entrepreneur plans to manufacture turbines suitable for remote, rural locations. And in Vandergrift, Pa., and Louisville, Colo., a window maker plans to retrofit aging factories to produce thin, insulated units that help make buildings more energy efficient. They\u2019re all projects getting federal funding designed to help small- and medium-sized manufacturers bring clean-energy jobs to former coal communities, part of a $1 trillion infrastructure package signed by President Biden in 2021. The Energy Department announced the projects on Monday. The program is an effort by the Biden administration to win support for its agenda to reduce American dependence on coal, oil and gas, the main drivers of global warming. But it also points to the broad realization that as the world transitions toward cleaner energy sources like wind and solar, workers in fossil-fuel industries \u2014 as well as regions that depend on them \u2014 risk getting left behind. Coal mining jobs have declined precipitously over the past decades, and there were less than 50,000 miners left in the United States in 2022, half the number 10 years ago, according to the latest figures from the Energy Information Agency. And these energy workers haven\u2019t been finding clean-energy jobs, despite the rapid growth in industries like solar and wind. A recent study that examined 130 million online work profiles found that in 2021, fewer than 1 percent of all workers who left jobs like coal, mining and oil and gas transitioned to \u201cgreen\u201d jobs in renewables. Coal workers, in particular, have struggled in the transition, the study found. Less than a quarter of a percent of workers who left a fossil fuel job in West Virginia moved onto a job in renewable energy, said E. Mark Curtis, an economist at Wake Forest University who led the study. Education was another factor: Fossil fuel workers without a college degree were significantly less likely to find clean energy jobs. \u201cIn places like Texas or in the middle of the country where there\u2019s a lot of solar and wind, fossil fuel communities are relatively well positioned to take advantage of renewables,\u201d Mr. Curtis said. \u201cCoal communities generally don\u2019t have that, especially when you think about Appalachia.\u201d He said it made sense for government funding to target former coal regions, and to focus on manufacturing projects, because data showed that former fossil fuel workers most frequently sought to switch to manufacturing jobs. \u201cI think that\u2019s a very viable type of transition for a lot of these workers and communities to make,\u201d he said. With the grant program, the United States is also trying to reclaim more clean-energy manufacturing, which China and other countries have come to dominate over the past decade. The goal is to \u201cbring new economic opportunities and ensure these communities continue their key role in strengthening America\u2019s national and energy security,\u201d said Jennifer M. Granholm, the U.S. Secretary of Energy. The program will distribute $275 million to seven projects in its initial round and the D.O.E. said it expects its funding to be matched by about $600 million more in private investment. The companies building the new plants said they are eager to tap local expertise. \u201cThe most valuable asset for the project is a legacy work force that has played a significant role in the U.S. metals industry,\u201d Tadeu Carneiro, the chief executive of Boston Metal, said in an interview. Its new West Virginia plant expects to hire 200 to 250 people and will manufacture ultrapure chromium metal and high temperature alloys that are critical materials needed for clean power, fuel cells and steel. Currently, foreign manufacturers dominate those materials. West Virginia Northern Community College, which teaches about 1,600 students in Weirton, said in a letter of support for the project that it was ready to set up courses and internships for students interested in jobs at Boston Metal. The proposed project, it said, \u201ccan help revitalize metals manufacturing in the region after decades of decline.\u201d", "summary": "An Energy Department program designed to create jobs and manufacturing in communities reliant on fossil fuels is backing projects in West Virginia, Colorado and elsewhere.", "authors": ["Hiroko Tabuchi"], "publish_date": "11-27-2023", "status": "success", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/27/climate/clean-energy-funding-coal-communities.html", "domain": "nytimes.com", "warc_date": "2023-11-27T20:00:00Z", "split": "gen", "inst_index": 7, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["Photo\nSix years ago, 12 new factories were planned in county where nearly half of all coal was mined. Eight of them were set to be located within a few miles of the county\u2019s largest city, Durham. But all of them have since been canceled or shelved.\nThe jobs will never be there, said Charles Garrard, a spokesman for the city. The cost to relocate the six factories to a less polluted county would be \u201castronomical,\u201d he said. The county, relying on the nearly $90 million in private investment in coal, would have no guarantee of success in green technology, he added.\nBut Mr. Garrard is trying to extract what he calls \u201ca win-win outcome.\u201d This week, the local chamber of commerce unveiled a new industrial park. The county is requesting bids for nine more electric car battery factories in a new district along the Old Forge waterfront.\nThe project, funded by the Volkswagen deal and the remaining major funding source in the 2010 economic recovery act, is the type of initiative favored by economists who argue that clean-energy companies, including those in the already renewable energy sector, should receive assistance from private sources.\nIt has pitted tax dollars for economic development against clean-energy jobs, one that has struggled to flourish in recent years. In a few years, heavy industry has all but disappeared here. Back in 2002, it was hard to find a job for college graduates. Now some remain, but mostly in the service economy. In other towns, a young worker looking for permanent employment can sometimes expect to work three jobs.\nNow the county has reached a decision.\nThe total of new factories slated to come to Durham remains about the same \u2014 six, Mr. Garrard said. They will cost $140 million each. The company in charge of the sites plans to form a third \u201cclean technology zone\u201d the county. \u201cWe want to create jobs that can\u2019t be taken away,\u201d Mr. Garrard said.\n"],

{"title": "Nom Nom Nom. What\u2019s the Deal With Cookie Monster\u2019s Cookies?", "text": "Years ago, a reader wrote probing for details on a mystery that had vexed him: What\u2019s the deal with the cookies that Cookie Monster eats? The email said nothing else. I chuckled and filed the note in the cupboard of my brain where such things go. Until I realized something: Me want cookies. And me want answers. Cookie Monster, for those of you who skipped childhood, is a classic muppet on \u201cSesame Street.\u201d He is a scraggly, blue fellow with bulging eyeballs, who has for decades been singularly obsessed with chaotically chowing down on cookies. The crumbs end up almost everywhere except his mouth, an effect that looks like a high-speed blender without a top. The character was created in the 1960s by Jim Henson, the creator of the Muppets, for a General Foods Canada commercial. Cookie eventually moved to \u201cSesame Street,\u201d where he presumably found a good rent-stabilized apartment. It turns out the cookies are real \u2014 sort of. They are baked at the home of Lara MacLean, who has been a \u201cpuppet wrangler\u201d for the Jim Henson Company for almost three decades. MacLean started as an intern for Sesame Workshop in 1992 and has been working for the team ever since. The recipe, roughly: Pancake mix, puffed rice, Grape-Nuts and instant coffee, with water in the mixture. The chocolate chips are made using hot glue sticks \u2014 essentially colored gobs of glue. The cookies do not have oils, fats or sugars. Those would stain Cookie Monster. They\u2019re edible, but barely. \u201cKind of like a dog treat,\u201d MacLean said in an interview. Before MacLean reinvented the recipe in the 2000s, the creative team behind \u201cSesame Street\u201d used versions of rice crackers and foams to make the cookies. The challenge was that the rice crackers would make more of a mess and get stuck in Cookie\u2019s fur. And the foams didn\u2019t look like cookies once they broke apart. For a given episode, depending on the script, MacLean will bake, on average, two dozen cookies. There\u2019s no oven large enough at Sesame\u2019s New York workplace, so MacLean does almost everything at home. This leads to the occasional awkward interaction, such as when MacLean once had to make huge batches of cookies for a series of Cookie Monster film spoofs. \u201cMy landlord came in my apartment at that time and I had all these cookies around and I was like, \u2018I\u2019m really sorry, I can\u2019t offer you a cookie.\u2019 And he probably just thought I was really mean,\u201d she said. On set, when Cookie is shooting, MacLean said the \u201cbest-case scenario\u201d was for the crumbs to end up all over the place. Sal Perez, the executive producer of \u201cSesame Street,\u201d said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be careful for the shrapnel that comes out when he\u2019s munching on the cookie.\u201d Cookie has been portrayed since 2001 by David Rudman, who took over the role from Frank Oz. Rudman\u2019s right hand moves the mouth, which is eating, and his left hand holds the cookies. Both work in concert to break the cookies, which means the cookies have to be soft enough to fall apart. Jason Weber, the workshop\u2019s creative supervisor, recalled Rudman complaining about a tough batch: \u201cMy hands are so sore. Don\u2019t make them like this ever again.\u201d Rudman said soft cookies are best, adding, \u201cThe more crumbs, the funnier it is.\u201d \u201cIf he eats the cookie, and it only breaks into two pieces if it\u2019s too hard, it\u2019s just not funny,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks almost painful. But if he eats a cookie and it explodes into a hundred crumbs, that\u2019s where the comedy comes from.\u201d MacLean has perfected a recipe that is \u201cthin enough that it\u2019ll explode into a hundred crumbs,\u201d Rudman said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not too thin that it\u2019ll break in my hand when I\u2019m holding it.\u201d Sometimes shoots don\u2019t go as planned. Cookie appeared on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in 2010 when Jeff Bridges was hosting. During the opening monologue, Bridges sang a duet with Cookie. The cookie that Bridges was supposed to offer Cookie broke in Bridges\u2019s pocket, so when he took it out, he only had half the cookie. So Bridges pulled out the other piece and improvised. \u201cNot only a half, but a whole cookie!\u201d Bridges said. Rudman responded as a delighted Cookie: \u201cTwice as good!\u201d Cookie doesn\u2019t just eat the cookies. He eats the plate they are on and has recently expanded the menu to include fruits and vegetables. Occasionally he devours inanimate objects like mailboxes. There is a small gullet in his mouth, so Cookie can actually eat something the size of a small fist. Bananas, apples and small hats go down easy, but most of the cookie crumbs end up outside his mouth. Not everyone realizes that the cookies aren\u2019t meant to be eaten. Adam Sandler appeared on a 2009 episode of \u201cSesame Street\u201d and decided to share in Cookie\u2019s delight by spontaneously eating a cookie with him on set. \u201cAs soon as the cameras cut, he was like, \u2018Bleeeech,\u2019\u201d MacLean said. Rudman said he told Sandler not to eat the cookies: \u201cI think he got caught up in the moment.\u201d It\u2019s hard not to. The 54th season of \u201cSesame Street\u201d just premiered on Max. Cookie is almost 60, but the core of his character endures. \u201cHe has sort of this base instinct that I think all of us have, even the youngest of us have,\u201d Perez said. \u201cOne of our first instincts is like: \u2018We see a cookie. We see a thing that we love and we just want it.\u2019\u201d", "summary": "If you have ever wondered what the \u201cSesame Street\u201d muppet is really eating, we have the answer.", "authors": ["Sopan Deb"], "publish_date": "11-27-2023", "status": "success", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/27/arts/television/cookie-monster-cookies.html", "domain": "nytimes.com", "warc_date": "2023-11-27T20:00:00Z", "split": "gen", "inst_index": 8, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["It was 1969. The hit song \u201cPorky\u2019s\u201d was topping the charts and the ad for the croissant stick was watching the sixth season of Sesame Street, a television show that changed kids\u2019 lives for decades.\nThat cookie stood 6 inches wide and 6 inches long and cost 50 cents, and that was just an average price, according to an account of the cookie in \u201cUp at Seven,\u201d a 2013 children\u2019s book by Laura Ratner, a New York author who attended a Sesame Street workshop at Mount Holyoke College. The show went on to air every weekday from 1969 to 2009, creating its own library of memorable characters and beloved theme songs.\nSesame Street blogger Marla Voight discovered that the cookie was popular enough to merit its own book.\n\u201cThat was one of the revelations of the show for me, that Cookie Monster was all about the cookies,\u201d Ms. Ratner told The New York Times. \u201cHe was kind of a fool in that they weren\u2019t meant to be there. They weren\u2019t meant to fit in, that they were for splurging at the end of the day or snacking on. And he didn\u2019t spend it.\u201d\nEven \u201cthe Cookie Monsterization of everything,\u201d as Ms. Ratner said, has led to cookie creations. In her new book, \u201cUp at Seven,\u201d a young girl creates four different cookie shapes.\nEven Cookie Monster himself may have cut a cookie off his fingers. The famous character once admitted to eating \u201cfour square cookies.\u201d\nNew Yorker writer Maria Konnikova, in an article from June 2014, explained how the edible story behind Cookie Monster began. The show, with such famous faces as Elmo, Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch, was taking its toll.\nOne day, Mr. Ernie and Mr. Bert were trying to climb the stairs. \u201cSomeone kept yelling at them,\u201d Konnikova wrote. \u201cWith every single bad step they took, Ernie and Bert were standing where they didn\u2019t belong.
