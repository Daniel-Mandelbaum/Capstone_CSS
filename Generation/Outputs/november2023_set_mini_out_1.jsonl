{"title": "David DePape found guilty in hammer attack on Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband", "text": "David DePape, the rightwing conspiracy theorist who attacked Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband in their San Francisco home, has been convicted of attempted kidnapping and assault. The federal jury\u2019s decision on Thursday comes after a dramatic trial in which Paul Pelosi testified about the \u201ctraumatic\u201d hammer attack he suffered on 28 October 2022, days before the midterm elections. DePape also took the stand in his defense, saying he had planned to interrogate the former House speaker and post footage of her online. The jury deliberated for about eight hours before finding DePape guilty of attempted kidnapping of a federal official and assault on the immediate family member of a federal official. DePape, who faces up to 50 years in prison, did not react as the verdict was read in court. Defense attorneys for DePape argued that he was caught up in conspiracy theories that influenced him to commit the crimes. DePape admitted in his own testimony during the trial that he broke into the Pelosis\u2019 house with a plan to hold the former House speaker hostage, and that he bludgeoned Paul Pelosi with a hammer after police officers showed up at the home. DePape, 43, echoed rightwing conspiracy theories and told jurors he had planned to wear an inflatable unicorn costume and record his interrogation of Nancy Pelosi to upload to the internet. Prosecutors say he had rope and zip ties with him. Detectives also found body cameras, a computer and a tablet. A sentencing date has not yet been set. At a news conference outside the federal courthouse where the verdict was read, the US attorney Ismail Ramsey told reporters: \u201cPeople can believe what they want and engage in passionate debate. But this guilty verdict on all counts sends a clear message that regardless of what your beliefs are, what you cannot do is physically attack a member of Congress or their immediate family for the performance of their job.\u201d  Prosecutors said that at the start of the attack at around 2am, DePape smashed through a door in the back of the Pelosis\u2019 house and encountered Paul Pelosi, then 82. He had been sleeping. DePape allegedly said: \u201cWhere\u2019s Nancy? Where\u2019s Nancy?\u201d as he stood over Paul Pelosi with zip ties and a hammer in his hands. Nancy Pelosi was in Washington DC during the break-in. Paul Pelosi managed to call police, and when two officers arrived, the officers saw DePape hit the speaker\u2019s husband in the head, which knocked him unconscious. Paul Pelosi was hospitalized with a skull fracture and injuries to his hands and arm. Part of the incident was captured on body-camera footage of police, and an FBI agent testified that the video indicated DePape hit him at least three times. \u201cIt was a tremendous shock to recognize that somebody had broken into the house and looking at him and looking at the hammer and the ties, I recognized that I was in serious danger, so I tried to stay as calm as possible,\u201d Paul Pelosi recounted to jurors. More than a year after the attack, Paul Pelosi said he still hadn\u2019t fully recovered. A neurosurgeon who operated on him testified that Pelosi had two wounds on his head, including a fracture to his skull that had to be mended with plates and screws he will have for the rest of his life. Pelosi also needed stitches on injuries to his right arm and hand, the surgeon said. DePape has a documented history of promoting conspiracy theories and far-right messages. On Facebook, he shared videos that falsely claimed the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump and misinformation about the January 6 insurrection. In court, DePape cried when he talked about his political beliefs, explaining how he came to support baseless narratives that a cabal of pedophiles were behind the US government. He also said he had wanted to talk to Nancy Pelosi about the 2016 election, and that he intended to question her while wearing an inflatable unicorn costume. \u201cHe was never my target and I\u2019m sorry that he got hurt,\u201d DePape said of Paul Pelosi. DePape and his attorneys did not deny he committed the attack. His lawyer, Jodi Linker, argued that he was not targeting Nancy Pelosi as retaliation for her official duties, but rather due to the conspiracy theories he believed \u201cwith every ounce of his body\u201d. In opening remarks, she said he was trying to stop the abuse of children and corruption: \u201cThis is not a whodunnit. But what the government fails to acknowledge is the \u2018whydunnit\u2019 \u2013 and the \u2018why\u2019 matters in this case.\u201d DePape is facing separate charges in state court, including attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, residential burglary and elderly abuse. He faces a potential life sentence in the state case and has pleaded not guilty, but that trial has not been set.", "summary": "Rightwing conspiracy theorist convicted of attempted kidnapping and assault in 2022 attack on Paul Pelosi", "authors": ["Sam Levin"], "publish_date": "11-16-2023", "status": "success", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/16/david-depape-guilty-paul-pelosi-trialn", "domain": "theguardian.com", "warc_date": "2023-11-16T16:01:03Z", "split": "gen", "inst_index": 83521, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["Nancy Pelosi was heckled at a charity event by her husband\nDavid DePape, an influential New York City rabbi, is among a quartet of former New York congressmen who have been found guilty of illegally wielding a hammer at Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband, the Democratic congresswoman from California.\nThere are now rumours of a TV advert starring the former governor of Texas, Bobby Jindal, dating back to 2004, possibly under the heading, \u201cnew chicanery\u201d. However, no specific appeals have been made to date for DePape\u2019s conviction.\nAccording to the New York Post, prosecutors are considering the possibility of five to six years in prison. A defence lawyer claimed Thursday that a recently undated pardon and parliamentary election bill could get them reduced to three years.\nDespite the threat of sentence, DePape is likely to get extra time for his offence.\nSeveral other Republicans in Congress also entered the guilty plea in response to charges of illegally wielding a hammer. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, pleaded guilty to an accusation of assault, and Salud Garcia of Colorado is awaiting sentencing.\nOne federal judge ruled for the prosecution in an October ruling that charges should have been dropped. The state had wanted to prosecute downstate DePape, who had sought to escape a court appearance for violating the Hatch Act, which protects secret government contracts.\n"], "gensraw_article": [[46,

{"title": "US business elite welcomes Xi Jinping with standing ovation", "text": "Crowding into the Hyatt Regency to meet the Chinese leader were Elon Musk of Tesla, Tim Cook of Apple and Albert Bourla of Pfizer, all keen on selling more electric cars, iPhones and pharmaceuticals in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. After a day spent in long-awaited talks with US President Joe Biden, Xi told an audience of about 300 people: \u201cChina is both a super-large economy and a super-large market\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009modernisation for 1.4bn Chinese is a huge opportunity that China provides to the world.\u201d \u201cThe world needs China and the US to work together for a better future,\u201d he added. \u201cChina is ready to be a partner and friend of the US.\u201d The warm feelings appeared mutual. \u201cIf you go through the list of the top 20 US companies in China, they were all there,\u201d said one San Francisco tech titan who attended the event but did not want his name to be published. On his way into the Hyatt, Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio told the Financial Times he was \u201cexcited to have this relationship [with Xi]\u201d. But while Xi made an effort to express his country\u2019s open welcome to US business, a combination of whipsawing tensions with Washington, a rocky economic recovery from the pandemic and Beijing\u2019s increasingly assertive domestic security apparatus has damped enthusiasm among American investors for making big bets on China. A series of US companies have begun packing up their bags or rerouting supply chains out of fear that geopolitical tensions could disrupt business. Technology groups such as Airbnb and LinkedIn have retreated from the country, as have consulting firms Gallup and Forrester Research. Even Apple, which has long relied on Chinese manufacturing, has begun sourcing orders in countries such as India and Vietnam. Business leaders and analysts said they did not expect Xi\u2019s summit with Biden to fully thaw relations. The two presidents agreed to restart military communications and set up a counter-narcotics working group to tackle fentanyl pouring into the US, but they left with several issues unresolved, most notably tensions over Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory. Myron Brilliant, former head of international relations for the US Chamber of Commerce, said while Chinese officials were reverting to the playbook of courting the business community for investment and to help manage ties with Washington, \u201ctimes have changed\u201d. \u201cBottom line is that American business leaders don\u2019t want to be caught in a game of chess between China and the US governments,\u201d said Brilliant. \u201cCEOs are risk-averse\u2009[and] the environment between China and the US has increased the risk of doing business in China.\u201d Increasingly vocal criticism of China by hawkish US politicians has further complicated a fraught environment for business leaders. On Tuesday, Mike Gallagher, chair of the House of Representatives\u2019 China committee, called it \u201cunconscionable\u201d that US executives were paying to attend the dinner with Xi, citing Beijing\u2019s repression of Muslim Uyghurs in China\u2019s north-western Xinjiang region and demanding a list of attendees. A Chinese-US executive at a tech company that straddles both countries told the FT that his attendance was a \u201cstate secret\u201d. Darren Woods, chief executive of ExxonMobil, which is in the process of building a multibillion-dollar petrochemical plant in southern China, told reporters on Wednesday morning that he would not attend the dinner. \u201cChinese and the US government relationships are going to kind of ebb and flow with time,\u201d Woods said. \u201cBoth countries are too important to the global world order to not find some balance, although that balance will shift.\u201d Shi Yinhong, an expert on US-China relations at Renmin University of China, said both governments\u2019 preoccupation with national security would set a ceiling on relations. \u201cIf economic interests conflict with national security, national security will undoubtedly take precedence,\u201d said Shi. China\u2019s increasingly forceful domestic security apparatus has unnerved many foreign businesses, conducting raids on US consultancy Bain & Co and detaining five local employees at due diligence group Mintz. Beijing has also banned the use of US group Micron\u2019s chips in critical infrastructure over cyber security risks. Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said Beijing\u2019s scrutiny of US businesses in the country was sending \u201cmixed messages\u201d and he hoped Xi\u2019s friendly rhetoric would trickle down through the bureaucracy. Given the uncertain trajectory for China\u2019s economy, which has been hit by a sluggish property sector and weak exports, Hart added that some US groups remained pessimistic. China has struggled to kick-start strong growth since lifting pandemic controls this year. But he said for many companies, \u201cChina is still an important market and profitable\u201d. Beijing \u201crealises that the private sector is getting quite nervous\u201d, said Emily Kilcrease, a technology expert at the CNAS think-tank. While Xi sought to reassure US businesses at the dinner, unless Beijing eases pressure on US multinationals and ceases imposing exit bans on foreign executives, \u201cthose concerns from the private sector will continue to persist despite the rhetoric\u201d, she added. Xi told business leaders in San Francisco: \u201cThe number one question for us is, are we adversaries or partners?\u201d If the US and China saw each other as rivals, he warned, \u201cit will only lead to misinformed policymaking, misguided actions and unwanted results\u201d.", "summary": "China\u2019s president projects friendly tone but analysts say increasing scrutiny has rattled foreign groups", "authors": ["Ryan McMorrow and Demetri Sevastopulo"], "publish_date": "11-15-2023", "status": "success", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a8633d7f-f785-4195-b0b2-0ea9506968c9", "domain": "ft.com", "warc_date": "2023-11-16T16:14:03Z", "split": "gen", "inst_index": 92751, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["Thank you for your help!\nWhat was mispronounced?
