{"title":"Biden plans to use cold-war era law in attempt to lower US prices","text":"The White House has announced it plans to use a cold-war era law to ease supply chain issues that the administration argues are contributing to higher inflation – a key electoral challenge to Joe Biden’s re-election chances next year as polling consistently suggests voters are not buying his Bidenomics pitch. In a statement, the White House said Biden will use the Defense Production Act to improve the domestic manufacturing of medicines deemed crucial for national security and will convene the first meeting of the president’s supply chain resilience council to announce other measures tied to the production and shipment of goods. “We’re determined to keep working to bring down prices for American consumers and ensure the resilience of our supply chains for the future,” said Lael Brainard, director of the White House national economic council and a co-chair of the new supply chain council, in a separate statement. The Defense Production Act of 1950, which was passed to streamline production during the Korean war, was last used in early 2021 during the coronavirus pandemic to accelerate and expand the availability of ventilators and personal protective equipment. The supply chain council is set to address issues ranging from improved data sharing between government agencies, supplying renewable energy resources and freight logistics. Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, will be co-chair of the council, which includes the heads of cabinet departments, the administration’s council of economic advisers, the US director of national intelligence, the Office of Management and Budget, and other agencies. Monday’s announcement arrived as the US economy appears to be doing well on paper. But the White House has acknowledged that improving economic picture is not shared by consumers, and the administration has explicitly tied the economy to the president by calling it Bidenomics. A recent Economist\/YouGov poll found that only 39% of voters approve of Biden’s handling of jobs and the economy. And a separate Reuters\/Ipsos poll puts the economy as the most important issue to Americans for the past two years. Even as the pace of inflation has slowed, consumers are shouldering an economic burden they had not experienced in years. Prices have risen as much in the past three years as they had in the previous decade, according to a report by Bloomberg, and it now costs almost $120 to buy the same goods and services a family could afford with $100 before the pandemic. According to Bloomberg, groceries and electricity are up 25%, used car prices have climbed 35%, auto insurance 33% and rent roughly 20% since January 2020. Housing affordability is at its worst on record. Auto-loan rates and credit card interest rates are also at a peak. As a result, many Democrats say it is time for Biden to adjust the economic message ahead of the 2024 election. In a statement, the White House said that “robust supply chains are fundamental to a strong economy”. “When supply chains are smooth, prices fall for goods, food, and equipment, putting more money in the pockets of American families, workers, farmers, and entrepreneurs,” the statement added. “Supply chain stress has eased measurably over the past year and the Biden administration’s announcement is another step in the right direction,” the Moody’s economist Jesse Rogers said. Rogers added: “While unlikely to resolve some of the more complex issues plaguing supply chains in one go, measures targeting pharmaceuticals, climate infrastructure, data security and logistics will bolster resilience and get the ball rolling on smart infrastructure and global cooperation.” In addition to domestic production measures, the administration said it will work to strengthen global supply chains internationally, including by developing early warning systems with allies and partners to detect and respond to supply chain disruptions in critical areas. Those include measures “to improve the weather, water, and climate observing capabilities and data-sharing” with countries “needed to produce global climate information and minimize impacts upon infrastructure, water, health, and food security”.","summary":"Defense Production Act of 1950, passed to streamline production during Korean war, was last used during Covid pandemic","authors":["Edward Helmore"],"publish_date":"11-27-2023","status":"success","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2023\/nov\/27\/biden-inflation-prices-defense-production-act","domain":"theguardian.com","warc_date":"2023-11-27T20:00:00Z","split":"gen","inst_index":1}
{"title":"UK detects its first human case of swine flu strain","text":"Health officials are scrambling to trace contacts of a person infected with a new form of swine flu, after the UK detected its first human case of H1N2. Fifty human cases of the strain have been reported globally since 2005. The new case is the first to be detected in the UK and is unrelated genetically to the previous cases. Influenza A(H1N2)v is similar to flu viruses circulating in pigs in the UK. The UK Health Security Agency has formally notified the World Health Organization (WHO) about the discovery. Based on early information, the infection detected in the UK is a distinct clade or form – 1b.1.1 – which is different from recent human cases of H1N2 elsewhere in the world. The person infected, who has not been identified, had a mild illness and has recovered. They were not hospitalised and were not known to have worked with pigs, the Guardian understands. How they came to be infected remains under investigation. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is carrying out contact tracing of close contacts to prevent further spread of the virus. It is not known at this stage how transmissible the strain is or if there could be other cases in the UK. Meera Chand, an incident director at UKHSA, said: “It is thanks to routine flu surveillance and genome sequencing that we have been able to detect this virus. This is the first time we have detected this virus in humans in the UK, though it is very similar to viruses that have been detected in pigs. “We are working rapidly to trace close contacts and reduce any potential spread. In accordance with established protocols, investigations are under way to learn how the individual acquired the infection and to assess whether there are any further associated cases.” Any contacts will be offered testing as necessary and advised on any necessary further care if they have symptoms or test positive. The UKHSA is also taking steps to increase surveillance within existing programmes involving GP surgeries and hospitals in parts of North Yorkshire. To assist in the detection of cases, people who are contacted and asked to test are being encouraged to do so. The chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, said: “We know that some diseases of animals can be transferred to humans – which is why high standards of animal health, welfare and biosecurity are so important. “Through our animal and human surveillance systems we work together to protect everyone. In this case, we are providing specialist veterinary and scientific knowledge to support the UKHSA investigation. Pig keepers must also report any suspicion of swine flu in their herds to their local vet immediately.” H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 are major subtypes of swine flu A viruses in pigs and occasionally infect humans. In 2009, there was a pandemic in humans caused by H1N1, commonly referred to as swine flu. This now circulates in humans seasonally.","summary":"Health officials scramble to trace contacts of person infected with H1N2 strain","authors":["Andrew Gregory"],"publish_date":"11-27-2023","status":"success","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2023\/nov\/27\/uk-detects-first-human-case-swine-flu-strain-h1n2","domain":"theguardian.com","warc_date":"2023-11-27T20:00:00Z","split":"gen","inst_index":2}
{"title":"Aid agencies welcome extension of Gaza truce but fear its end","text":"Aid agencies have welcomed the two-day extension of the truce in Gaza but voiced concern that the anticipated resumption of Israel’s attack on Hamas would lead to an even deeper humanitarian crisis among Palestinians. Save the Children said it would try to continue to provide what it described as basic relief aid – bottled water, food and essential medicines – some of which it had been able to help deliver during the first four days of the truce. “We welcome the two-day extension. It shows what can be done, but we hugely fear what comes next if fighting restarts,” said James Deneslow, the head of the British charity’s conflict team. A particular concern, Deneslow added, was the impact on people in the crowded south of the strip, where it is estimated by Israel and aid agencies that about 2 million people are now living around Khan Younis and elsewhere. Many fled south after Israel demanded they evacuate the northern area around Gaza City last month. Israel’s political leaders and military have repeatedly signalled they intended to resume attacking Gaza whenever the truce expires. Its terms mean it can be extended for a day for every 10 further hostages released by Hamas. The next step of Israel’s attack on Gaza is expected to involve both an attempt to eliminate Hamas’s remaining fighting force in the north and to root it out from Khan Younis, where it believes the group’s leadership is based, despite the large numbers of civilians present. Sources close to the Israel Defense Forces leadership indicated on Monday that they believed the most likely approach would be to try to demand local evacuations of the population on a village or district basis before attacking. Analysts believe the next phase of the war could last a couple of months or more once fighting restarts. A high proportion of buildings – on some estimates up to 50% – have been seriously damaged in northern Gaza, after an intense air bombardment and ground assault. Khan Younis has also been bombed, but to a lesser extent, and the US has told Israel that it expects to see its military take a different approach in future. Deneslow said that “the issue is where will Gaza’s people go” in any southern offensive and added “there is sensitivity about population displacement”. There is a fear among aid organisations that the Palestinian population could eventually be forced from the Strip into Egypt amid critical shortages of water, food and other necessities, he added. Mike Noyes, humanitarian lead with ActionAid UK, said that while the organisation had been able to deliver some aid during the truce, including hot food for people sheltering in the south, it had not been able to deliver fuel to the al-Awda hospital in the north of Gaza that it works with. It was also difficult to operate logistics effectively when operating over short timeframes such as a day or two, the aid agency said. “You can’t plan these things on a day-by-day basis, which is why we’ve been calling for a proper ceasefire,” Noyes said. The UN relief agency UNRWA said on Monday that “small amounts of cooking gas” had been delivered into Gaza over the past three days, for the first time since the start of the conflict. It said the amounts provided were “well short of the needs” of the population. Hamas’s bloody surprise attack on 7 October killed 1,200 Israelis. Israel’s military response has led to the deaths of more than 14,800 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry, and about 73% are women and children.","summary":"Concern voiced over deeper humanitarian crisis that may follow if Israel resumes attack on Hamas","authors":["Dan Sabbagh"],"publish_date":"11-27-2023","status":"success","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2023\/nov\/27\/aid-agencies-welcome-extension-of-gaza-truce-but-fear-its-end","domain":"theguardian.com","warc_date":"2023-11-27T20:00:00Z","split":"gen","inst_index":3}
{"title":"Doctors encouraged by early-stage trial of MS stem cell therapy","text":"Doctors are cautiously hopeful about a new multiple sclerosis therapy after finding that injecting stem cells into patients’ brains was safe and potentially protective against further damage from the disease. The small, early stage trial was only able to assess whether injecting cells directly into the brain was well tolerated by patients, but in tests carried out in the year after treatment, researchers found hints that the cells may have a long-lasting, beneficial impact. “We don’t know yet whether this is the beginning of a fantastic journey or not, but the results are very strong and very consistent,” said Prof Stefano Pluchino at the University of Cambridge. More than 2 million people worldwide live with multiple sclerosis. While most existing drugs target the early, relapsing remitting phase of the disease, two-thirds of patients still move on to the secondary, progressive and increasingly debilitating stage within 30 years of diagnosis. The disease occurs when the body’s immune system attacks the protective myelin sheaths that wrap around nerve fibres, causing damage that disrupts how electric signals are beamed around the nervous system. For the first in-human trial of the therapy, researchers injected between 5m and 24m neural stem cells directly into the brains of 15 patients with secondary progressive MS. Rather than rebuilding damaged tissues, the stem cells are thought to reduce the inflammation that drives the disease. Some patients on the trial experienced side-effects, with one developing a tremor and another steroid-induced psychosis, but all recovered with treatment. Tests on the patients over the following year found that none reported any worsening symptoms or increased disability, though most were using wheelchairs before the study and may not have deteriorated anyway. Brain scans revealed that patients who received higher doses of stem cells experienced less brain shrinkage, perhaps because the stem cells were dampening inflammation. What intrigued the scientists most were tests on the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord. These revealed that patients who received more stem cells had higher levels of compounds called carnitines, which are thought to protect neurons from damage. “What does it mean? I have no idea. But it is incredibly exciting,” said Pluchino. Details are published in Cell Stem Cell. The researchers are now keen to run a larger trial to confirm whether or not the injections are changing the course of the disease. One factor they need to rule out is any effect from the immunosuppressive drugs patients took to prevent rejection of the stem cells. Prof Paolo Muraro, an expert in neuroimmunology at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the study, said the trial set a benchmark for the manufacture and quality control of the cell-based drug. Further challenges remain, however. One is scaling up the therapy and making it affordable for large trials to investigate how effective the treatment is. “It is a long journey for hope, but certainly a worthy one,” Muraro said. Caitlin Astbury at the MS Society said it was “a really exciting study” that built on previous research funded by charity. “These results show that special stem cells injected into the brain were safe and well-tolerated by people with secondary progressive MS,” she said. “They also suggest this treatment approach might even stabilise disability progression. We’ve known for some time that this method has the potential to help protect the brain from progression in MS. “This was a very small, early-stage study and we need further clinical trials to find out if this treatment has a beneficial effect on the condition. But this is an encouraging step towards a new way of treating some people with MS.”","summary":"Injecting stem cells into patients’ brains found to be safe and could stop further damage from the disease","authors":["Ian Sample"],"publish_date":"11-27-2023","status":"success","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/science\/2023\/nov\/27\/doctors-encouraged-by-early-stage-trial-of-ms-stem-cell-therapy","domain":"theguardian.com","warc_date":"2023-11-27T20:00:00Z","split":"gen","inst_index":4}
{"title":"Meta designed platforms to get children addicted, court documents allege","text":"Instagram and Facebook parent company Meta purposefully engineered its platforms to addict children and knowingly allowed underage users to hold accounts, according to a newly unsealed legal complaint. The complaint is a key part of a lawsuit filed against Meta by the attorneys general of 33 states in late October and was originally redacted. It alleges the social media company knew – but never disclosed – it had received millions of complaints about underage users on Instagram but only disabled a fraction of those accounts. The large number of underage users was an “open secret” at the company, the suit alleges, citing internal company documents. In one example, the lawsuit cites an internal email thread in which employees discuss why a 12-year-old girl’s four accounts were not deleted following complaints from the girl’s mother stating her daughter was 12 years old and requesting the accounts to be taken down. The employees concluded that “the accounts were ignored” in part because representatives of Meta “couldn’t tell for sure the user was underage”. The complaint said that in 2021, Meta received over 402,000 reports of under-13 users on Instagram but that 164,000 – far fewer than half of the reported accounts – were “disabled for potentially being under the age of 13” that year. The complaint noted that at times Meta has a backlog of up to 2.5m accounts of younger children awaiting action. The complaint alleges this and other incidents violate the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act, which requires that social media companies provide notice and get parental consent before collecting data from children. The lawsuit also focuses on longstanding assertions that Meta knowingly created products that were addictive and harmful to children, brought into sharp focus by whistleblower Frances Haugen, who revealed that internal studies showed platforms like Instagram led children to anorexia-related content. Haugen also stated the company intentionally targets children under the age of 18. Company documents cited in the complaint described several Meta officials acknowledging the company designed its products to exploit shortcomings in youthful psychology, including a May 2020 internal presentation called “teen fundamentals” which highlighted certain vulnerabilities of the young brain that could be exploited by product development. The presentation discussed teen brains’ relative immaturity, and teenagers’ tendency to be driven by “emotion, the intrigue of novelty and reward” and asked how these asked how these characteristics could “manifest . . . in product usage”. Meta said in a statement that the complaint misrepresents its work over the past decade to make the online experience safe for teens, noting it has “over 30 tools to support them and their parents”. With respect to barring younger users from the service, Meta argued age verification is a “complex industry challenge”. Instead, Meta said it favors shifting the burden of policing underage usage to app stores and parents like Google and Apple, specifically by supporting federal legislation that would require app stores to obtain parental approval whenever youths under 16 download apps. One Facebook safety executive alluded to the possibility that cracking down on younger users might hurt the company’s business in a 2019 email. But a year later, the same executive expressed frustration that while Facebook readily studied the usage of underage users for business reasons, it didn’t show the same enthusiasm for ways to identify younger kids and remove them from its platforms.","summary":"Instagram and Facebook parent company also knowingly allowed underage users to hold accounts, unsealed legal complaint says","authors":["Kari Paul"],"publish_date":"11-27-2023","status":"success","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2023\/nov\/27\/meta-instagram-facebook-kids-addicted-lawsuit","domain":"theguardian.com","warc_date":"2023-11-27T20:00:00Z","split":"gen","inst_index":5}
{"title":"Nikki Haley Is Coming for Your Retirement","text":"It feels like years ago, but actually only a few months have passed since many big Republican donors seemed to believe that Ron DeSantis could effectively challenge Donald Trump for the Republican nomination. It has been an edifying spectacle — an object lesson in the reality that great wealth need not be associated with good judgment, about politics or anything else. At this point, both conventional wisdom and prediction markets say that Trump has a virtual lock on the nomination. But Wall Street isn’t completely resigned to Trump’s inevitability; there has been a late surge in big-money support for Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina. And there is, to be fair, still a chance that Trump — who is facing many criminal charges and whose public rants have become utterly unhinged — will manage to crash and burn before securing the nomination. So it seems worth looking at what Haley stands for. From a political point of view, one answer might be: nothing. A recent Times profile described her as having “an ability to calibrate her message to the moment.” A less euphemistic way to put this is that she seems willing to say whatever might work to her political advantage. “Flip-flopping” doesn’t really convey the sheer cynicism with which she has shifted her rhetoric and changed her positions on everything from abortion rights to immigration to whether it’s OK to try overturning a national election. And anyone hoping that she would govern as a moderate if she should somehow make it to the White House is surely delusional. Haley has never really shown a willingness to stand up to Republican extremists — and at this point the whole G.O.P. has been taken over by extremists. That said, Haley has shown some consistency on issues of economic and fiscal policy. And what you should know is that her positions on these issues are pretty far to the right. In particular, she seems exceptionally explicit, even among would-be Republican nominees, in calling for an increase in the age at which Americans become eligible for Social Security — a bad idea that seems to be experiencing a revival. So let’s talk about Social Security. The first thing you should know about Social Security is that the actual numbers don’t justify the apocalyptic rhetoric one often hears, not just from the right but from self-proclaimed centrists who want to sound serious. No, the exhaustion of the system’s trust fund, currently projected to occur in roughly a decade, wouldn’t mean that benefits disappear. It would mean that the system would need additional revenue to continue paying scheduled benefits in full. But the extra revenue required would be smaller than you probably think. The most recent long-term projections from the Congressional Budget Office show Social Security outlays rising to 6.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2053 from 5.1 percent this year, not exactly an earth-shattering increase. It’s true that the budget office projects a much bigger rise in spending on Medicare and other major health programs. But much of this projected rise reflects the assumption that medical costs will rise much faster than economic growth, which has been true in the past but need not be true in the future. Indeed, since 2010, Medicare spending has been far less than expected. And there is every reason to believe that smart policies could further curb health care costs, given how much more America spends than other wealthy nations. Still, Social Security does face a funding gap. How should it be closed? Anyone who says, as Haley does, that the retirement age should rise in line with increasing life expectancy is being oblivious, perhaps willfully, to the grim inequality of modern America. Until Covid struck, average life expectancy at 65, the relevant number, was indeed rising. But these gains were concentrated among Americans with relatively high incomes. Less affluent Americans — those who depend most on Social Security — have seen little rise in life expectancy, and in some cases actual declines. So anyone invoking rising life expectancy as a reason to delay Social Security benefits is, in effect, saying that aging janitors must keep working (or be cast into extreme poverty) because bankers are living longer. How, then, should the Social Security gap be closed? The obvious answer — which happens to be favored by a majority of voters — is to raise more revenue. Remember, America collects less revenue as a percentage of G.D.P. than almost any other advanced economy. But Haley, of course, wants to cut income taxes. My guess is that none of this will be relevant, that Trump will be the nominee. But if he stumbles, I would beg political reporters not to focus on Haley’s personal affect, which can seem moderate, but rather on her policies. On social issues and the fate of democracy, she appears to be a pure weather vane, turning with the political winds. On fiscal and economic policy, she’s a hard-right advocate of tax cuts for the rich and benefit cuts for the working class. If calling someone a “populist” has any meaning these days, she’s the exact opposite.","summary":"Nikki Haley Is Coming for Your Retirement","authors":["Paul Krugman"],"publish_date":"11-27-2023","status":"success","url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/11\/27\/opinion\/nikki-haley-social-security.html","domain":"nytimes.com","warc_date":"2023-11-27T20:00:00Z","split":"gen","inst_index":6}
{"title":"Former Coal Towns Get Money for Clean-Energy Factories","text":"In Weirton, W.Va., in the heart of coal country, a company started by MIT scientists plans to build a plant that will produce a metal and alloy critical for clean energy, fuel cells and cleaner steel. In Vernon, Texas, also a former coal town, a third-generation wind entrepreneur plans to manufacture turbines suitable for remote, rural locations. And in Vandergrift, Pa., and Louisville, Colo., a window maker plans to retrofit aging factories to produce thin, insulated units that help make buildings more energy efficient. They’re all projects getting federal funding designed to help small- and medium-sized manufacturers bring clean-energy jobs to former coal communities, part of a $1 trillion infrastructure package signed by President Biden in 2021. The Energy Department announced the projects on Monday. The program is an effort by the Biden administration to win support for its agenda to reduce American dependence on coal, oil and gas, the main drivers of global warming. But it also points to the broad realization that as the world transitions toward cleaner energy sources like wind and solar, workers in fossil-fuel industries — as well as regions that depend on them — risk getting left behind. Coal mining jobs have declined precipitously over the past decades, and there were less than 50,000 miners left in the United States in 2022, half the number 10 years ago, according to the latest figures from the Energy Information Agency. And these energy workers haven’t been finding clean-energy jobs, despite the rapid growth in industries like solar and wind. A recent study that examined 130 million online work profiles found that in 2021, fewer than 1 percent of all workers who left jobs like coal, mining and oil and gas transitioned to “green” jobs in renewables. Coal workers, in particular, have struggled in the transition, the study found. Less than a quarter of a percent of workers who left a fossil fuel job in West Virginia moved onto a job in renewable energy, said E. Mark Curtis, an economist at Wake Forest University who led the study. Education was another factor: Fossil fuel workers without a college degree were significantly less likely to find clean energy jobs. “In places like Texas or in the middle of the country where there’s a lot of solar and wind, fossil fuel communities are relatively well positioned to take advantage of renewables,” Mr. Curtis said. “Coal communities generally don’t have that, especially when you think about Appalachia.” He said it made sense for government funding to target former coal regions, and to focus on manufacturing projects, because data showed that former fossil fuel workers most frequently sought to switch to manufacturing jobs. “I think that’s a very viable type of transition for a lot of these workers and communities to make,” he said. With the grant program, the United States is also trying to reclaim more clean-energy manufacturing, which China and other countries have come to dominate over the past decade. The goal is to “bring new economic opportunities and ensure these communities continue their key role in strengthening America’s national and energy security,” said Jennifer M. Granholm, the U.S. Secretary of Energy. The program will distribute $275 million to seven projects in its initial round and the D.O.E. said it expects its funding to be matched by about $600 million more in private investment. The companies building the new plants said they are eager to tap local expertise. “The most valuable asset for the project is a legacy work force that has played a significant role in the U.S. metals industry,” Tadeu Carneiro, the chief executive of Boston Metal, said in an interview. Its new West Virginia plant expects to hire 200 to 250 people and will manufacture ultrapure chromium metal and high temperature alloys that are critical materials needed for clean power, fuel cells and steel. Currently, foreign manufacturers dominate those materials. West Virginia Northern Community College, which teaches about 1,600 students in Weirton, said in a letter of support for the project that it was ready to set up courses and internships for students interested in jobs at Boston Metal. The proposed project, it said, “can help revitalize metals manufacturing in the region after decades of decline.”","summary":"An Energy Department program designed to create jobs and manufacturing in communities reliant on fossil fuels is backing projects in West Virginia, Colorado and elsewhere.","authors":["Hiroko Tabuchi"],"publish_date":"11-27-2023","status":"success","url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/11\/27\/climate\/clean-energy-funding-coal-communities.html","domain":"nytimes.com","warc_date":"2023-11-27T20:00:00Z","split":"gen","inst_index":7}
{"title":"Nom Nom Nom. What’s the Deal With Cookie Monster’s Cookies?","text":"Years ago, a reader wrote probing for details on a mystery that had vexed him: What’s the deal with the cookies that Cookie Monster eats? The email said nothing else. I chuckled and filed the note in the cupboard of my brain where such things go. Until I realized something: Me want cookies. And me want answers. Cookie Monster, for those of you who skipped childhood, is a classic muppet on “Sesame Street.” He is a scraggly, blue fellow with bulging eyeballs, who has for decades been singularly obsessed with chaotically chowing down on cookies. The crumbs end up almost everywhere except his mouth, an effect that looks like a high-speed blender without a top. The character was created in the 1960s by Jim Henson, the creator of the Muppets, for a General Foods Canada commercial. Cookie eventually moved to “Sesame Street,” where he presumably found a good rent-stabilized apartment. It turns out the cookies are real — sort of. They are baked at the home of Lara MacLean, who has been a “puppet wrangler” for the Jim Henson Company for almost three decades. MacLean started as an intern for Sesame Workshop in 1992 and has been working for the team ever since. The recipe, roughly: Pancake mix, puffed rice, Grape-Nuts and instant coffee, with water in the mixture. The chocolate chips are made using hot glue sticks — essentially colored gobs of glue. The cookies do not have oils, fats or sugars. Those would stain Cookie Monster. They’re edible, but barely. “Kind of like a dog treat,” MacLean said in an interview. Before MacLean reinvented the recipe in the 2000s, the creative team behind “Sesame Street” used versions of rice crackers and foams to make the cookies. The challenge was that the rice crackers would make more of a mess and get stuck in Cookie’s fur. And the foams didn’t look like cookies once they broke apart. For a given episode, depending on the script, MacLean will bake, on average, two dozen cookies. There’s no oven large enough at Sesame’s New York workplace, so MacLean does almost everything at home. This leads to the occasional awkward interaction, such as when MacLean once had to make huge batches of cookies for a series of Cookie Monster film spoofs. “My landlord came in my apartment at that time and I had all these cookies around and I was like, ‘I’m really sorry, I can’t offer you a cookie.’ And he probably just thought I was really mean,” she said. On set, when Cookie is shooting, MacLean said the “best-case scenario” was for the crumbs to end up all over the place. Sal Perez, the executive producer of “Sesame Street,” said, “You’ve got to be careful for the shrapnel that comes out when he’s munching on the cookie.” Cookie has been portrayed since 2001 by David Rudman, who took over the role from Frank Oz. Rudman’s right hand moves the mouth, which is eating, and his left hand holds the cookies. Both work in concert to break the cookies, which means the cookies have to be soft enough to fall apart. Jason Weber, the workshop’s creative supervisor, recalled Rudman complaining about a tough batch: “My hands are so sore. Don’t make them like this ever again.” Rudman said soft cookies are best, adding, “The more crumbs, the funnier it is.” “If he eats the cookie, and it only breaks into two pieces if it’s too hard, it’s just not funny,” he said. “It looks almost painful. But if he eats a cookie and it explodes into a hundred crumbs, that’s where the comedy comes from.” MacLean has perfected a recipe that is “thin enough that it’ll explode into a hundred crumbs,” Rudman said. “But it’s not too thin that it’ll break in my hand when I’m holding it.” Sometimes shoots don’t go as planned. Cookie appeared on “Saturday Night Live” in 2010 when Jeff Bridges was hosting. During the opening monologue, Bridges sang a duet with Cookie. The cookie that Bridges was supposed to offer Cookie broke in Bridges’s pocket, so when he took it out, he only had half the cookie. So Bridges pulled out the other piece and improvised. “Not only a half, but a whole cookie!” Bridges said. Rudman responded as a delighted Cookie: “Twice as good!” Cookie doesn’t just eat the cookies. He eats the plate they are on and has recently expanded the menu to include fruits and vegetables. Occasionally he devours inanimate objects like mailboxes. There is a small gullet in his mouth, so Cookie can actually eat something the size of a small fist. Bananas, apples and small hats go down easy, but most of the cookie crumbs end up outside his mouth. Not everyone realizes that the cookies aren’t meant to be eaten. Adam Sandler appeared on a 2009 episode of “Sesame Street” and decided to share in Cookie’s delight by spontaneously eating a cookie with him on set. “As soon as the cameras cut, he was like, ‘Bleeeech,’” MacLean said. Rudman said he told Sandler not to eat the cookies: “I think he got caught up in the moment.” It’s hard not to. The 54th season of “Sesame Street” just premiered on Max.

{"title":"Israel tells Elon Musk Starlink can only operate in Gaza with its approval","text":"Israel has told Elon Musk his Starlink satellite network will only be allowed to operate in Gaza with its approval, as the entrepreneur met the country’s leaders amid a furore over alleged antisemitism on his social platform X. The world’s richest man declared late last month that his satellite internet service Starlink would “support connectivity to internationally recognised aid organisations in Gaza”, which has suffered lengthy blackouts under Israel’s bombardment. But on Monday, Israeli communications minister Shlomo Karhi posted on X that the entrepreneur had “reach[ed] a principle understanding” with the ministry. “Starlink satellite units can only be operated in Israel with the approval of the Israeli Ministry of Communications, including the Gaza Strip,” Karhi said. Musk has not yet publicly confirmed any deal. The SpaceX and Tesla chief executive is visiting the Jewish state for the first time since Hamas’s October 7 assault on southern Israel, which killed 1,200 people and triggered a war between Israel and the militant group. Israel’s ferocious retaliatory bombardment and siege of the strip has created a humanitarian crisis, killed more than 13,300 people and led to prolonged blackouts. These have obstructed rescue efforts, notably by preventing ambulances from locating wounded people. Musk’s visit to Israel coincides with the last day of a four-day pause in hostilities, and comes as advertisers pile pressure on X over a rise in antisemitism on the platform. After appearing to endorse an antisemitic conspiracy theory, which a White House spokesperson said was “abhorrent”, Musk has been forced to defend himself from charges of discrimination. “Nothing could be further from the truth,” he said on X this month. “I wish only the best for humanity.” A video released by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office showed Musk wearing a flak jacket as he toured burnt-out homes in Kfar Aza, a kibbutz devastated by the militant group’s assault, taking pictures on his mobile phone. “Actions speak louder than words,” Musk posted cryptically on X after the visit. Musk’s initial commitment to enable Starlink in Gaza, which followed telecommunications blackouts in the enclave, sparked a spat with the Israeli government, which argued the connectivity would be used by Hamas for “terrorist activities”. Starlink, part of Musk’s rockets and satellites company SpaceX, uses a constellation of Earth-orbiting satellites to beam internet connectivity into places where traditional access to the web is difficult. Musk has provided Starlink equipment to Ukraine’s frontline with Russia. The Starlink signal is received through small satellite dishes called terminals. But Musk said in October that no terminals had actually attempted to connect from besieged Gaza, and Israel controls the movement of goods into the coastal enclave. During the seven-week war, Israel has at times reportedly cut communications to the strip, while local mobile provider Paltel struggled to source enough fuel to keep its network running. NetBlocks, an internet access tracker, reported improved connectivity in Gaza on Saturday, after Paltel said engineers had repaired damaged network infrastructure during a temporary ceasefire.","summary":"Entrepreneur meets country’s leaders amid furore over alleged antisemitism on his social platform X","authors":["Chloe Cornish"],"publish_date":"11-27-2023","status":"success","url":"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/67a874e3-42fb-4c69-8d74-212f2fed5d0e","domain":"ft.com","warc_date":"2023-11-27T20:00:00Z","split":"gen","inst_index":9}
{"title":"Commercial vessel and US destroyer attacked off Yemen, says US military","text":"Missiles were fired from rebel-controlled territory in Yemen towards an Israeli-affiliated vessel and a US naval destroyer, according to the US military, highlighting the growing threat to ships in one of the world’s most important trade corridors. The two missiles landed several miles away from the commercial vessel Central Park in the Gulf of Aden and the USS Mason that was responding to its distress call, US central command said in a statement on Monday. Central Park, a Liberia-flagged oil and chemical products carrier, had earlier been boarded by unknown assailants, according to Centcom. The USS Mason pursued the small boat on which the five attackers fled and secured their surrender. The Pentagon said later on Monday that the assailants appeared to be Somali pirates, rather than rebels from the Houthi movement that controls a swath of Yemen. “We’re continuing to assess, but initial indications are that these five individuals are Somali,” said Brigadier-General Patrick Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman. “Clearly a piracy-related incident,” he added. Concerns had arisen that the Central Park incident could have marked another attempt by the Iran-allied rebels to hijack a commercial vessel. Houthi forces last week used helicopters to board and hijack an Israeli-linked vehicle carrier in the Red Sea and divert it to a nearby port under their control. The operation displayed “a significant increase in the Houthis’ capability to disrupt merchant shipping” and was probably carried out with Iranian involvement, security consultancy Ambrey said. Central Park’s owner, UK-based Zodiac Maritime, confirmed that the vessel had been attacked by “pirates”, but that all of the crew, the vessel and its cargo were unharmed. Zodiac is controlled by the Ofer family, Israel’s best-known ship owners. The incident comes amid growing tensions in shipping lanes around the Horn of Africa since Israel launched its war in Gaza last month. The Iran-backed Houthis have warned that they would target Israeli-linked vessels from their heartlands in northern Yemen. The Houthi threat has combined with shelling from Iran-backed Hizbollah in Lebanon to form an Iranian proxy pincer movement against Israel, raising fears that the contained war in Gaza could spill over into regional conflagration. In the wake of Israel’s military bombardment of Gaza, the Houthis have also made several attempts to launch long-range ballistic missiles at the southern Israeli city of Eilat, where air defences and US naval vessels have shot down incoming fire. Saudi Arabia led an Arab coalition to intervene in the Yemeni civil war in 2015 after the Houthis ousted the internationally recognised, Riyadh-allied government from power in the capital Sana’a. A feature of the war was attacks on merchant shipping in the Gulf and Houthi missile strikes against Saudi oil installations and United Arab Emirates commercial infrastructure. The war also triggered one of the world’s worst man-made humanitarian disasters, killing hundreds of thousands through fighting, malnutrition and disease. About two-thirds of Yemen’s population still require humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. A fragile truce between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis has held since April last year, with Houthi delegations being hosted in Riyadh for talks seeking to make the ceasefire permanent. A deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran, brokered by China, to restore diplomatic relations had also helped to ease Gulf tensions before the Israel-Gaza war broke out. “Maritime domain security is essential to regional stability,” General Michael Kurilla, Centcom commander, said of the attacks on Monday. “We will continue to work with allies and partners to ensure the safety and security of international shipping lanes.”","summary":"Incident underlines growing threat to ships travelling in one of world’s most important trade corridors","authors":["Simeon Kerr"],"publish_date":"11-27-2023","status":"success","url":"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/0d3bda63-c378-477e-bac4-824945812bf6","domain":"ft.com","warc_date":"2023-11-27T20:00:00Z","split":"gen","inst_index":10}
{"title":"Sacrifice zone: booming US LNG sector leaves its mark on the Gulf","text":"For decades communities on the US Gulf Coast in Louisiana and Texas have lived in the shadows of gigantic petrochemical factories belching out toxins that earned their regions ignominious monikers, such as “Cancer Alley” and “Death Valley”. Now, amid an unprecedented boom in liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, the fossil fuel industry is targeting these same communities to host a fresh wave of industrial facilities with the promise of jobs and investment. But some locals are demanding a halt to the buildout, arguing they are becoming collateral damage in a race to safeguard European energy supplies following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine — and boost corporate profits. “You’re talking about communities that are already overburdened with pollution,” said Roishetta Sibley Ozane, a mother of six children living in Sulphur, a suburb of Lake Charles on Louisiana’s Gulf coast. Ozane lives close to the Citgo Lake Charles refinery — one of the US’s largest — and several petrochemical plants, whose presence is ever visible from the orange glow caused by the flaring of gases. Two of the country’s biggest LNG facilities — Sempra’s Cameron LNG and Venture Global LNG’s Calcasieu Pass — sit within a 50km radius and companies are proposing to build half a dozen more in the vicinity. She claims the pollution is causing health problems for her 11-year old daughter Kamea, including asthma, eczema and a rare skin condition called Gianotti-Crosti syndrome which manifests itself in a bumpy rash. “All of our kids that were born and raised here are now experiencing these issues because we live so close to these facilities,” she said. “What they [the companies] keep telling us is that because we already have all the industry and the pipelines, that’s why . . . they’re building the LNG. They’re saying it’s cleaner than the petrochemical facilities that we already have — but we know that that’s a lie.” A surge in US LNG exports has helped to wean Europe off Russian gas in the wake of the Ukraine war. It is also a boon to the US economy, which thanks to a two-decades-long boom in shale oil and gas production moved from a net importer of energy to a net exporter in 2019. This year the US overtook Qatar to become the world’s largest LNG exporter. Its seven existing terminals can produce as much as 11.4bn cubic feet a day, according to the Energy Information Administration — enough to satisfy the combined gas needs of Germany and France. Five more projects will add another 9.7bn cf\/d. Dozens other LNG projects have been proposed, most of them for them around the Texas-Louisiana border. The LNG industry says the investment boom is generating hundreds of billions of dollars in investment, boosting the energy security of US allies in Europe and Asia, and creating tens of thousands of jobs in areas where many people live below the poverty line. But communities living in the shadow of the mass infrastructure buildout say they have been forgotten by policymakers — and that their concerns over displacement, pollution and climate change have been largely ignored. “This is a sacrifice zone,” said John Beard, a former refinery worker and community activist in nearby Port Arthur, one of the poorest cities in Texas. It is a term used by advocates for environmental justice in areas that have been scarred by decades of fossil fuel production. “All of these: Lake Charles, Port Arthur, Freeport, Corpus Christi, Brownsville.” “Because of what happened in Ukraine [they say] that American gas is freedom gas — we’re no longer being held hostage by Russia. Well we have a saying in the states: freedom ain’t free . . . The price we pay for it is pollution.” The LNG boom has posed a headache for US President Joe Biden, who campaigned on the most ambitious climate agenda in the country’s history and has prioritised environmental justice in his administration. Yet the president has encouraged gas exports to support European allies. A month after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, Biden announced a pact with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen that would entail the US boosting exports to the EU in order to displace Russian energy. “This industry brings economic and geopolitical benefits to the US, but it isn’t always easy to reconcile with Biden’s climate goals,” said Ben Cahill, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The big question is: should the government step in to limit construction of new LNG facilities, or should it let the market decide if there is sufficient gas demand and financing for these projects to be built? So far, the latter approach has worked well, but it’s getting harder to sustain.” Local communities argue the industry is guilty of “environmental racism”, focusing the buildout of these projects in poor, mainly black or immigrant communities, which have little power to object. “These facilities are overwhelmingly sited in or near low-income and people of colour communities,” Ozane said. “The communities that they’re near don’t even have their basic needs . . . Yet these facilities get to operate, extract the resources from this community [and] export those resources somewhere else.” Campaigners point to the petrochemical and LNG industry’s poor safety record — and weak state regulations on pollution. Last year a huge explosion ripped through Freeport LNG in Texas sending a massive fireball into the air and forcing one of the country’s largest facilities offline for months. The industry insists it is doing its bit for local communities. Dustin Meyer, senior vice-president at the American Petroleum Institute, said: “We will continue to collaborate with local leaders to support the fair treatment and meaningful engagement of communities with environmental justice concerns.” Charlie Riedl, executive director at the Center for LNG in Washington, said LNG export projects “represent a sizeable if not the largest source of local tax revenue in these communities and this will have a positive local impact for years to come”. He said companies had “invested billions of dollars throughout local communities” both in projects and also in “job training, secondary and tertiary investments and other local needs”. Safety is the “bedrock” of the US LNG industry, Riedl added. Activists say the continued expansion of LNG infrastructure is locking in reliance on the fossil fuels whose combustion causes global warming — which has in turn contributed to the increasingly destructive hurricanes that have battered the Gulf in recent years. “If we ever keep building more fossil fuel infrastructure and these enormous facilities, we are locking ourselves into a future that we already know is just going to be full of more climate chaos,” said James Hiatt, founder of For a Better Bayou, a group campaigning against expansion of LNG facilities in the region and a speedier transition away from fossil fuels. “People have lived on this land for generations, fathers and grandfathers, and they are now being forced off by climate change. And those that haven’t given up and now being forced off by these massive facilities. Who wants to live next to this? Nobody.” Campaigners have vowed not to limit the fight to the US, taking their case to parliaments and boardrooms from Europe to Asia, scoring some successes. In March, French banking giant Société Générale withdrew its financial support from NextDecade’s Rio Grande LNG project, proposed in Brownsville, Texas. This followed lobbying by indigenous leaders from Texas who travelled to Europe to voice opposition to the customers and funders who finance LNG developers. However, NextDecade in July made a final investment decision to proceed with construction. In September Ireland’s planning agency refused permission for the construction of an LNG import terminal proposed by US-based New Fortress Energy, which was opposed by campaigners, including Hollywood actor Mark Ruffalo. “People are sick and tired of being sick and tired,” said Beard, who travelled to Brussels this month to make his case to members of the European parliament. Yet Europe’s thirst for LNG continues to rise and EU capitals are still rushing to sign up more long-term import deals, underwriting the construction of new export plants. It will help US LNG rise from a fifth of global supply to a quarter by 2026, according to the International Energy Agency. He and other local activists say they will step up their campaign to halt LNG developments by not just opposing their planning and licensing but also targeting the banks, private equity and insurance companies that back them. Beard said: “Picket signs and protest lines ain’t gonna get it — we gotta start attacking the money.”","summary":"Rising gas exports have eased Europe’s energy crisis — but worsened life in communities near the plants","authors":["Jamie Smyth","Myles McCormick"],"publish_date":"11-27-2023","status":"success","url":"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/5c051556-6efd-4db3-9152-508d7e0de566","domain":"ft.com","warc_date":"2023-11-27T20:00:00Z","split":"gen","inst_index":11}
