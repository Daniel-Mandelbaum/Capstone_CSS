{"title":"Biden plans to use cold-war era law in attempt to lower US prices","text":"The White House has announced it plans to use a cold-war era law to ease supply chain issues that the administration argues are contributing to higher inflation – a key electoral challenge to Joe Biden’s re-election chances next year as polling consistently suggests voters are not buying his Bidenomics pitch. In a statement, the White House said Biden will use the Defense Production Act to improve the domestic manufacturing of medicines deemed crucial for national security and will convene the first meeting of the president’s supply chain resilience council to announce other measures tied to the production and shipment of goods. “We’re determined to keep working to bring down prices for American consumers and ensure the resilience of our supply chains for the future,” said Lael Brainard, director of the White House national economic council and a co-chair of the new supply chain council, in a separate statement. The Defense Production Act of 1950, which was passed to streamline production during the Korean war, was last used in early 2021 during the coronavirus pandemic to accelerate and expand the availability of ventilators and personal protective equipment. The supply chain council is set to address issues ranging from improved data sharing between government agencies, supplying renewable energy resources and freight logistics. Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, will be co-chair of the council, which includes the heads of cabinet departments, the administration’s council of economic advisers, the US director of national intelligence, the Office of Management and Budget, and other agencies. Monday’s announcement arrived as the US economy appears to be doing well on paper. But the White House has acknowledged that improving economic picture is not shared by consumers, and the administration has explicitly tied the economy to the president by calling it Bidenomics. A recent Economist\/YouGov poll found that only 39% of voters approve of Biden’s handling of jobs and the economy. And a separate Reuters\/Ipsos poll puts the economy as the most important issue to Americans for the past two years. Even as the pace of inflation has slowed, consumers are shouldering an economic burden they had not experienced in years. Prices have risen as much in the past three years as they had in the previous decade, according to a report by Bloomberg, and it now costs almost $120 to buy the same goods and services a family could afford with $100 before the pandemic. According to Bloomberg, groceries and electricity are up 25%, used car prices have climbed 35%, auto insurance 33% and rent roughly 20% since January 2020. Housing affordability is at its worst on record. Auto-loan rates and credit card interest rates are also at a peak. As a result, many Democrats say it is time for Biden to adjust the economic message ahead of the 2024 election. In a statement, the White House said that “robust supply chains are fundamental to a strong economy”. “When supply chains are smooth, prices fall for goods, food, and equipment, putting more money in the pockets of American families, workers, farmers, and entrepreneurs,” the statement added. “Supply chain stress has eased measurably over the past year and the Biden administration’s announcement is another step in the right direction,” the Moody’s economist Jesse Rogers said. Rogers added: “While unlikely to resolve some of the more complex issues plaguing supply chains in one go, measures targeting pharmaceuticals, climate infrastructure, data security and logistics will bolster resilience and get the ball rolling on smart infrastructure and global cooperation.” In addition to domestic production measures, the administration said it will work to strengthen global supply chains internationally, including by developing early warning systems with allies and partners to detect and respond to supply chain disruptions in critical areas. Those include measures “to improve the weather, water, and climate observing capabilities and data-sharing” with countries “needed to produce global climate information and minimize impacts upon infrastructure, water, health, and food security”.","summary":"Defense Production Act of 1950, passed to streamline production during Korean war, was last used during Covid pandemic","authors":["Edward Helmore"],"publish_date":"11-27-2023","status":"success","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2023\/nov\/27\/biden-inflation-prices-defense-production-act","domain":"theguardian.com","warc_date":"2023-11-27T20:00:00Z","split":"gen","inst_index":1}
{"title":"UK detects its first human case of swine flu strain","text":"Health officials are scrambling to trace contacts of a person infected with a new form of swine flu, after the UK detected its first human case of H1N2. Fifty human cases of the strain have been reported globally since 2005. The new case is the first to be detected in the UK and is unrelated genetically to the previous cases. Influenza A(H1N2)v is similar to flu viruses circulating in pigs in the UK. The UK Health Security Agency has formally notified the World Health Organization (WHO) about the discovery. Based on early information, the infection detected in the UK is a distinct clade or form – 1b.1.1 – which is different from recent human cases of H1N2 elsewhere in the world. The person infected, who has not been identified, had a mild illness and has recovered. They were not hospitalised and were not known to have worked with pigs, the Guardian understands. How they came to be infected remains under investigation. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is carrying out contact tracing of close contacts to prevent further spread of the virus. It is not known at this stage how transmissible the strain is or if there could be other cases in the UK. Meera Chand, an incident director at UKHSA, said: “It is thanks to routine flu surveillance and genome sequencing that we have been able to detect this virus. This is the first time we have detected this virus in humans in the UK, though it is very similar to viruses that have been detected in pigs. “We are working rapidly to trace close contacts and reduce any potential spread. In accordance with established protocols, investigations are under way to learn how the individual acquired the infection and to assess whether there are any further associated cases.” Any contacts will be offered testing as necessary and advised on any necessary further care if they have symptoms or test positive. The UKHSA is also taking steps to increase surveillance within existing programmes involving GP surgeries and hospitals in parts of North Yorkshire. To assist in the detection of cases, people who are contacted and asked to test are being encouraged to do so. The chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, said: “We know that some diseases of animals can be transferred to humans – which is why high standards of animal health, welfare and biosecurity are so important. “Through our animal and human surveillance systems we work together to protect everyone. In this case, we are providing specialist veterinary and scientific knowledge to support the UKHSA investigation. Pig keepers must also report any suspicion of swine flu in their herds to their local vet immediately.” H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 are major subtypes of swine flu A viruses in pigs and occasionally infect humans. In 2009, there was a pandemic in humans caused by H1N1, commonly referred to as swine flu. This now circulates in humans seasonally.","summary":"Health officials scramble to trace contacts of person infected with H1N2 strain","authors":["Andrew Gregory"],"publish_date":"11-27-2023","status":"success","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2023\/nov\/27\/uk-detects-first-human-case-swine-flu-strain-h1n2","domain":"theguardian.com","warc_date":"2023-11-27T20:00:00Z","split":"gen","inst_index":2}
{"title":"Aid agencies welcome extension of Gaza truce but fear its end","text":"Aid agencies have welcomed the two-day extension of the truce in Gaza but voiced concern that the anticipated resumption of Israel’s attack on Hamas would lead to an even deeper humanitarian crisis among Palestinians. Save the Children said it would try to continue to provide what it described as basic relief aid – bottled water, food and essential medicines – some of which it had been able to help deliver during the first four days of the truce. “We welcome the two-day extension. It shows what can be done, but we hugely fear what comes next if fighting restarts,” said James Deneslow, the head of the British charity’s conflict team. A particular concern, Deneslow added, was the impact on people in the crowded south of the strip, where it is estimated by Israel and aid agencies that about 2 million people are now living around Khan Younis and elsewhere. Many fled south after Israel demanded they evacuate the northern area around Gaza City last month. Israel’s political leaders and military have repeatedly signalled they intended to resume attacking Gaza whenever the truce expires. Its terms mean it can be extended for a day for every 10 further hostages released by Hamas. The next step of Israel’s attack on Gaza is expected to involve both an attempt to eliminate Hamas’s remaining fighting force in the north and to root it out from Khan Younis, where it believes the group’s leadership is based, despite the large numbers of civilians present. Sources close to the Israel Defense Forces leadership indicated on Monday that they believed the most likely approach would be to try to demand local evacuations of the population on a village or district basis before attacking. Analysts believe the next phase of the war could last a couple of months or more once fighting restarts. A high proportion of buildings – on some estimates up to 50% – have been seriously damaged in northern Gaza, after an intense air bombardment and ground assault. Khan Younis has also been bombed, but to a lesser extent, and the US has told Israel that it expects to see its military take a different approach in future. Deneslow said that “the issue is where will Gaza’s people go” in any southern offensive and added “there is sensitivity about population displacement”. There is a fear among aid organisations that the Palestinian population could eventually be forced from the Strip into Egypt amid critical shortages of water, food and other necessities, he added. Mike Noyes, humanitarian lead with ActionAid UK, said that while the organisation had been able to deliver some aid during the truce, including hot food for people sheltering in the south, it had not been able to deliver fuel to the al-Awda hospital in the north of Gaza that it works with. It was also difficult to operate logistics effectively when operating over short timeframes such as a day or two, the aid agency said. “You can’t plan these things on a day-by-day basis, which is why we’ve been calling for a proper ceasefire,” Noyes said. The UN relief agency UNRWA said on Monday that “small amounts of cooking gas” had been delivered into Gaza over the past three days, for the first time since the start of the conflict. It said the amounts provided were “well short of the needs” of the population. Hamas’s bloody surprise attack on 7 October killed 1,200 Israelis. Israel’s military response has led to the deaths of more than 14,800 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry, and about 73% are women and children.","summary":"Concern voiced over deeper humanitarian crisis that may follow if Israel resumes attack on Hamas","authors":["Dan Sabbagh"],"publish_date":"11-27-2023","status":"success","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2023\/nov\/27\/aid-agencies-welcome-extension-of-gaza-truce-but-fear-its-end","domain":"theguardian.com","warc_date":"2023-11-27T20:00:00Z","split":"gen","inst_index":3}
{"title":"Doctors encouraged by early-stage trial of MS stem cell therapy","text":"Doctors are cautiously hopeful about a new multiple sclerosis therapy after finding that injecting stem cells into patients’ brains was safe and potentially protective against further damage from the disease. The small, early stage trial was only able to assess whether injecting cells directly into the brain was well tolerated by patients, but in tests carried out in the year after treatment, researchers found hints that the cells may have a long-lasting, beneficial impact. “We don’t know yet whether this is the beginning of a fantastic journey or not, but the results are very strong and very consistent,” said Prof Stefano Pluchino at the University of Cambridge. More than 2 million people worldwide live with multiple sclerosis. While most existing drugs target the early, relapsing remitting phase of the disease, two-thirds of patients still move on to the secondary, progressive and increasingly debilitating stage within 30 years of diagnosis. The disease occurs when the body’s immune system attacks the protective myelin sheaths that wrap around nerve fibres, causing damage that disrupts how electric signals are beamed around the nervous system. For the first in-human trial of the therapy, researchers injected between 5m and 24m neural stem cells directly into the brains of 15 patients with secondary progressive MS. Rather than rebuilding damaged tissues, the stem cells are thought to reduce the inflammation that drives the disease. Some patients on the trial experienced side-effects, with one developing a tremor and another steroid-induced psychosis, but all recovered with treatment. Tests on the patients over the following year found that none reported any worsening symptoms or increased disability, though most were using wheelchairs before the study and may not have deteriorated anyway. Brain scans revealed that patients who received higher doses of stem cells experienced less brain shrinkage, perhaps because the stem cells were dampening inflammation. What intrigued the scientists most were tests on the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord. These revealed that patients who received more stem cells had higher levels of compounds called carnitines, which are thought to protect neurons from damage. “What does it mean? I have no idea. But it is incredibly exciting,” said Pluchino. Details are published in Cell Stem Cell. The researchers are now keen to run a larger trial to confirm whether or not the injections are changing the course of the disease. One factor they need to rule out is any effect from the immunosuppressive drugs patients took to prevent rejection of the stem cells. Prof Paolo Muraro, an expert in neuroimmunology at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the study, said the trial set a benchmark for the manufacture and quality control of the cell-based drug. Further challenges remain, however. One is scaling up the therapy and making it affordable for large trials to investigate how effective the treatment is. “It is a long journey for hope, but certainly a worthy one,” Muraro said. Caitlin Astbury at the MS Society said it was “a really exciting study” that built on previous research funded by charity. “These results show that special stem cells injected into the brain were safe and well-tolerated by people with secondary progressive MS,” she said. “They also suggest this treatment approach might even stabilise disability progression. We’ve known for some time that this method has the potential to help protect the brain from progression in MS. “This was a very small, early-stage study and we need further clinical trials to find out if this treatment has a beneficial effect on the condition. But this is an encouraging step towards a new way of treating some people with MS.”","summary":"Injecting stem cells into patients’ brains found to be safe and could stop further damage from the disease","authors":["Ian Sample"],"publish_date":"11-27-2023","status":"success","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/science\/2023\/nov\/27\/doctors-encouraged-by-early-stage-trial-of-ms-stem-cell-therapy","domain":"theguardian.com","warc_date":"2023-11-27T20:00:00Z","split":"gen","inst_index":4}
{"title":"Meta designed platforms to get children addicted, court documents allege","text":"Instagram and Facebook parent company Meta purposefully engineered its platforms to addict children and knowingly allowed underage users to hold accounts, according to a newly unsealed legal complaint. The complaint is a key part of a lawsuit filed against Meta by the attorneys general of 33 states in late October and was originally redacted. It alleges the social media company knew – but never disclosed – it had received millions of complaints about underage users on Instagram but only disabled a fraction of those accounts. The large number of underage users was an “open secret” at the company, the suit alleges, citing internal company documents. In one example, the lawsuit cites an internal email thread in which employees discuss why a 12-year-old girl’s four accounts were not deleted following complaints from the girl’s mother stating her daughter was 12 years old and requesting the accounts to be taken down. The employees concluded that “the accounts were ignored” in part because representatives of Meta “couldn’t tell for sure the user was underage”. The complaint said that in 2021, Meta received over 402,000 reports of under-13 users on Instagram but that 164,000 – far fewer than half of the reported accounts – were “disabled for potentially being under the age of 13” that year. The complaint noted that at times Meta has a backlog of up to 2.5m accounts of younger children awaiting action. The complaint alleges this and other incidents violate the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act, which requires that social media companies provide notice and get parental consent before collecting data from children. The lawsuit also focuses on longstanding assertions that Meta knowingly created products that were addictive and harmful to children, brought into sharp focus by whistleblower Frances Haugen, who revealed that internal studies showed platforms like Instagram led children to anorexia-related content. Haugen also stated the company intentionally targets children under the age of 18. Company documents cited in the complaint described several Meta officials acknowledging the company designed its products to exploit shortcomings in youthful psychology, including a May 2020 internal presentation called “teen fundamentals” which highlighted certain vulnerabilities of the young brain that could be exploited by product development. The presentation discussed teen brains’ relative immaturity, and teenagers’ tendency to be driven by “emotion, the intrigue of novelty and reward” and asked how these asked how these characteristics could “manifest . . . in product usage”. Meta said in a statement that the complaint misrepresents its work over the past decade to make the online experience safe for teens, noting it has “over 30 tools to support them and their parents”. With respect to barring younger users from the service, Meta argued age verification is a “complex industry challenge”. Instead, Meta said it favors shifting the burden of policing underage usage to app stores and parents like Google and Apple, specifically by supporting federal legislation that would require app stores to obtain parental approval whenever youths under 16 download apps. One Facebook safety executive alluded to the possibility that cracking down on younger users might hurt the company’s business in a 2019 email. But a year later, the same executive expressed frustration that while Facebook readily studied the usage of underage users for business reasons, it didn’t show the same enthusiasm for ways to identify younger kids and remove them from its platforms.","summary":"Instagram and Facebook parent company also knowingly allowed underage users to hold accounts, unsealed legal complaint says","authors":["Kari Paul"],"publish_date":"11-27-2023","status":"success","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2023\/nov\/27\/meta-instagram-facebook-kids-addicted-lawsuit","domain":"theguardian.com","warc_date":"2023-11-27T20:00:00Z","split":"gen","inst_index":5}
