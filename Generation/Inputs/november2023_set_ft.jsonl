{"title":"Israel tells Elon Musk Starlink can only operate in Gaza with its approval","text":"Israel has told Elon Musk his Starlink satellite network will only be allowed to operate in Gaza with its approval, as the entrepreneur met the country’s leaders amid a furore over alleged antisemitism on his social platform X. The world’s richest man declared late last month that his satellite internet service Starlink would “support connectivity to internationally recognised aid organisations in Gaza”, which has suffered lengthy blackouts under Israel’s bombardment. But on Monday, Israeli communications minister Shlomo Karhi posted on X that the entrepreneur had “reach[ed] a principle understanding” with the ministry. “Starlink satellite units can only be operated in Israel with the approval of the Israeli Ministry of Communications, including the Gaza Strip,” Karhi said. Musk has not yet publicly confirmed any deal. The SpaceX and Tesla chief executive is visiting the Jewish state for the first time since Hamas’s October 7 assault on southern Israel, which killed 1,200 people and triggered a war between Israel and the militant group. Israel’s ferocious retaliatory bombardment and siege of the strip has created a humanitarian crisis, killed more than 13,300 people and led to prolonged blackouts. These have obstructed rescue efforts, notably by preventing ambulances from locating wounded people. Musk’s visit to Israel coincides with the last day of a four-day pause in hostilities, and comes as advertisers pile pressure on X over a rise in antisemitism on the platform. After appearing to endorse an antisemitic conspiracy theory, which a White House spokesperson said was “abhorrent”, Musk has been forced to defend himself from charges of discrimination. “Nothing could be further from the truth,” he said on X this month. “I wish only the best for humanity.” A video released by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office showed Musk wearing a flak jacket as he toured burnt-out homes in Kfar Aza, a kibbutz devastated by the militant group’s assault, taking pictures on his mobile phone. “Actions speak louder than words,” Musk posted cryptically on X after the visit. Musk’s initial commitment to enable Starlink in Gaza, which followed telecommunications blackouts in the enclave, sparked a spat with the Israeli government, which argued the connectivity would be used by Hamas for “terrorist activities”. Starlink, part of Musk’s rockets and satellites company SpaceX, uses a constellation of Earth-orbiting satellites to beam internet connectivity into places where traditional access to the web is difficult. Musk has provided Starlink equipment to Ukraine’s frontline with Russia. The Starlink signal is received through small satellite dishes called terminals. But Musk said in October that no terminals had actually attempted to connect from besieged Gaza, and Israel controls the movement of goods into the coastal enclave. During the seven-week war, Israel has at times reportedly cut communications to the strip, while local mobile provider Paltel struggled to source enough fuel to keep its network running. NetBlocks, an internet access tracker, reported improved connectivity in Gaza on Saturday, after Paltel said engineers had repaired damaged network infrastructure during a temporary ceasefire.","summary":"Entrepreneur meets country’s leaders amid furore over alleged antisemitism on his social platform X","authors":["Chloe Cornish"],"publish_date":"11-27-2023","status":"success","url":"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/67a874e3-42fb-4c69-8d74-212f2fed5d0e","domain":"ft.com","warc_date":"2023-11-27T20:00:00Z","split":"gen","inst_index":9}
{"title":"Commercial vessel and US destroyer attacked off Yemen, says US military","text":"Missiles were fired from rebel-controlled territory in Yemen towards an Israeli-affiliated vessel and a US naval destroyer, according to the US military, highlighting the growing threat to ships in one of the world’s most important trade corridors. The two missiles landed several miles away from the commercial vessel Central Park in the Gulf of Aden and the USS Mason that was responding to its distress call, US central command said in a statement on Monday. Central Park, a Liberia-flagged oil and chemical products carrier, had earlier been boarded by unknown assailants, according to Centcom. The USS Mason pursued the small boat on which the five attackers fled and secured their surrender. The Pentagon said later on Monday that the assailants appeared to be Somali pirates, rather than rebels from the Houthi movement that controls a swath of Yemen. “We’re continuing to assess, but initial indications are that these five individuals are Somali,” said Brigadier-General Patrick Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman. “Clearly a piracy-related incident,” he added. Concerns had arisen that the Central Park incident could have marked another attempt by the Iran-allied rebels to hijack a commercial vessel. Houthi forces last week used helicopters to board and hijack an Israeli-linked vehicle carrier in the Red Sea and divert it to a nearby port under their control. The operation displayed “a significant increase in the Houthis’ capability to disrupt merchant shipping” and was probably carried out with Iranian involvement, security consultancy Ambrey said. Central Park’s owner, UK-based Zodiac Maritime, confirmed that the vessel had been attacked by “pirates”, but that all of the crew, the vessel and its cargo were unharmed. Zodiac is controlled by the Ofer family, Israel’s best-known ship owners. The incident comes amid growing tensions in shipping lanes around the Horn of Africa since Israel launched its war in Gaza last month. The Iran-backed Houthis have warned that they would target Israeli-linked vessels from their heartlands in northern Yemen. The Houthi threat has combined with shelling from Iran-backed Hizbollah in Lebanon to form an Iranian proxy pincer movement against Israel, raising fears that the contained war in Gaza could spill over into regional conflagration. In the wake of Israel’s military bombardment of Gaza, the Houthis have also made several attempts to launch long-range ballistic missiles at the southern Israeli city of Eilat, where air defences and US naval vessels have shot down incoming fire. Saudi Arabia led an Arab coalition to intervene in the Yemeni civil war in 2015 after the Houthis ousted the internationally recognised, Riyadh-allied government from power in the capital Sana’a. A feature of the war was attacks on merchant shipping in the Gulf and Houthi missile strikes against Saudi oil installations and United Arab Emirates commercial infrastructure. The war also triggered one of the world’s worst man-made humanitarian disasters, killing hundreds of thousands through fighting, malnutrition and disease. About two-thirds of Yemen’s population still require humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. A fragile truce between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis has held since April last year, with Houthi delegations being hosted in Riyadh for talks seeking to make the ceasefire permanent. A deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran, brokered by China, to restore diplomatic relations had also helped to ease Gulf tensions before the Israel-Gaza war broke out. “Maritime domain security is essential to regional stability,” General Michael Kurilla, Centcom commander, said of the attacks on Monday. “We will continue to work with allies and partners to ensure the safety and security of international shipping lanes.”","summary":"Incident underlines growing threat to ships travelling in one of world’s most important trade corridors","authors":["Simeon Kerr"],"publish_date":"11-27-2023","status":"success","url":"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/0d3bda63-c378-477e-bac4-824945812bf6","domain":"ft.com","warc_date":"2023-11-27T20:00:00Z","split":"gen","inst_index":10}
{"title":"Sacrifice zone: booming US LNG sector leaves its mark on the Gulf","text":"For decades communities on the US Gulf Coast in Louisiana and Texas have lived in the shadows of gigantic petrochemical factories belching out toxins that earned their regions ignominious monikers, such as “Cancer Alley” and “Death Valley”. Now, amid an unprecedented boom in liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, the fossil fuel industry is targeting these same communities to host a fresh wave of industrial facilities with the promise of jobs and investment. But some locals are demanding a halt to the buildout, arguing they are becoming collateral damage in a race to safeguard European energy supplies following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine — and boost corporate profits. “You’re talking about communities that are already overburdened with pollution,” said Roishetta Sibley Ozane, a mother of six children living in Sulphur, a suburb of Lake Charles on Louisiana’s Gulf coast. Ozane lives close to the Citgo Lake Charles refinery — one of the US’s largest — and several petrochemical plants, whose presence is ever visible from the orange glow caused by the flaring of gases. Two of the country’s biggest LNG facilities — Sempra’s Cameron LNG and Venture Global LNG’s Calcasieu Pass — sit within a 50km radius and companies are proposing to build half a dozen more in the vicinity. She claims the pollution is causing health problems for her 11-year old daughter Kamea, including asthma, eczema and a rare skin condition called Gianotti-Crosti syndrome which manifests itself in a bumpy rash. “All of our kids that were born and raised here are now experiencing these issues because we live so close to these facilities,” she said. “What they [the companies] keep telling us is that because we already have all the industry and the pipelines, that’s why . . . they’re building the LNG. They’re saying it’s cleaner than the petrochemical facilities that we already have — but we know that that’s a lie.” A surge in US LNG exports has helped to wean Europe off Russian gas in the wake of the Ukraine war. It is also a boon to the US economy, which thanks to a two-decades-long boom in shale oil and gas production moved from a net importer of energy to a net exporter in 2019. This year the US overtook Qatar to become the world’s largest LNG exporter. Its seven existing terminals can produce as much as 11.4bn cubic feet a day, according to the Energy Information Administration — enough to satisfy the combined gas needs of Germany and France. Five more projects will add another 9.7bn cf\/d. Dozens other LNG projects have been proposed, most of them for them around the Texas-Louisiana border. The LNG industry says the investment boom is generating hundreds of billions of dollars in investment, boosting the energy security of US allies in Europe and Asia, and creating tens of thousands of jobs in areas where many people live below the poverty line. But communities living in the shadow of the mass infrastructure buildout say they have been forgotten by policymakers — and that their concerns over displacement, pollution and climate change have been largely ignored. “This is a sacrifice zone,” said John Beard, a former refinery worker and community activist in nearby Port Arthur, one of the poorest cities in Texas. It is a term used by advocates for environmental justice in areas that have been scarred by decades of fossil fuel production. “All of these: Lake Charles, Port Arthur, Freeport, Corpus Christi, Brownsville.” “Because of what happened in Ukraine [they say] that American gas is freedom gas — we’re no longer being held hostage by Russia. Well we have a saying in the states: freedom ain’t free . . . The price we pay for it is pollution.” The LNG boom has posed a headache for US President Joe Biden, who campaigned on the most ambitious climate agenda in the country’s history and has prioritised environmental justice in his administration. Yet the president has encouraged gas exports to support European allies. A month after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, Biden announced a pact with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen that would entail the US boosting exports to the EU in order to displace Russian energy. “This industry brings economic and geopolitical benefits to the US, but it isn’t always easy to reconcile with Biden’s climate goals,” said Ben Cahill, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The big question is: should the government step in to limit construction of new LNG facilities, or should it let the market decide if there is sufficient gas demand and financing for these projects to be built? So far, the latter approach has worked well, but it’s getting harder to sustain.” Local communities argue the industry is guilty of “environmental racism”, focusing the buildout of these projects in poor, mainly black or immigrant communities, which have little power to object. “These facilities are overwhelmingly sited in or near low-income and people of colour communities,” Ozane said. “The communities that they’re near don’t even have their basic needs . . . Yet these facilities get to operate, extract the resources from this community [and] export those resources somewhere else.” Campaigners point to the petrochemical and LNG industry’s poor safety record — and weak state regulations on pollution. Last year a huge explosion ripped through Freeport LNG in Texas sending a massive fireball into the air and forcing one of the country’s largest facilities offline for months. The industry insists it is doing its bit for local communities. Dustin Meyer, senior vice-president at the American Petroleum Institute, said: “We will continue to collaborate with local leaders to support the fair treatment and meaningful engagement of communities with environmental justice concerns.” Charlie Riedl, executive director at the Center for LNG in Washington, said LNG export projects “represent a sizeable if not the largest source of local tax revenue in these communities and this will have a positive local impact for years to come”. He said companies had “invested billions of dollars throughout local communities” both in projects and also in “job training, secondary and tertiary investments and other local needs”. Safety is the “bedrock” of the US LNG industry, Riedl added. Activists say the continued expansion of LNG infrastructure is locking in reliance on the fossil fuels whose combustion causes global warming — which has in turn contributed to the increasingly destructive hurricanes that have battered the Gulf in recent years. “If we ever keep building more fossil fuel infrastructure and these enormous facilities, we are locking ourselves into a future that we already know is just going to be full of more climate chaos,” said James Hiatt, founder of For a Better Bayou, a group campaigning against expansion of LNG facilities in the region and a speedier transition away from fossil fuels. “People have lived on this land for generations, fathers and grandfathers, and they are now being forced off by climate change. And those that haven’t given up and now being forced off by these massive facilities. Who wants to live next to this? Nobody.” Campaigners have vowed not to limit the fight to the US, taking their case to parliaments and boardrooms from Europe to Asia, scoring some successes. In March, French banking giant Société Générale withdrew its financial support from NextDecade’s Rio Grande LNG project, proposed in Brownsville, Texas. This followed lobbying by indigenous leaders from Texas who travelled to Europe to voice opposition to the customers and funders who finance LNG developers. However, NextDecade in July made a final investment decision to proceed with construction. In September Ireland’s planning agency refused permission for the construction of an LNG import terminal proposed by US-based New Fortress Energy, which was opposed by campaigners, including Hollywood actor Mark Ruffalo. “People are sick and tired of being sick and tired,” said Beard, who travelled to Brussels this month to make his case to members of the European parliament. Yet Europe’s thirst for LNG continues to rise and EU capitals are still rushing to sign up more long-term import deals, underwriting the construction of new export plants. It will help US LNG rise from a fifth of global supply to a quarter by 2026, according to the International Energy Agency. He and other local activists say they will step up their campaign to halt LNG developments by not just opposing their planning and licensing but also targeting the banks, private equity and insurance companies that back them. Beard said: “Picket signs and protest lines ain’t gonna get it — we gotta start attacking the money.”","summary":"Rising gas exports have eased Europe’s energy crisis — but worsened life in communities near the plants","authors":["Jamie Smyth","Myles McCormick"],"publish_date":"11-27-2023","status":"success","url":"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/5c051556-6efd-4db3-9152-508d7e0de566","domain":"ft.com","warc_date":"2023-11-27T20:00:00Z","split":"gen","inst_index":11}
