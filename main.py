This innovation could significantly reduce the cost of solar energy, making it more accessible worldwide. The new design integrates a novel material, which the company has named \"LumiLayer,\" into the traditional silicon-based solar panels. This material enhances the absorption of sunlight and reduces energy loss, a key challenge in solar technology. \"We've developed a way to capture a broader spectrum of sunlight and convert it more efficiently into usable energy,\" explained Dr. Emily Zhang, Chief Technology Officer at SunnovaTech. SunnovaTech's breakthrough has garnered attention from major energy companies and environmental groups. According to preliminary tests, these panels can achieve up to 40% efficiency, a substantial increase from the current average of 15-20%. \"This isn't just a step forward; it's a leap for solar energy,\" said Dr. Zhang. In addition to their increased efficiency, the new panels are designed to be more durable and easier to install. SunnovaTech has stated that these panels can be integrated into existing solar farms and residential setups with minimal modifications. The company plans to begin mass production by mid-2024, following further testing and certification. Environmentalists are hopeful about the potential impact of this technology. \"Doubling solar panel efficiency could accelerate our transition to renewable energy and significantly reduce carbon emissions,\" said Alex Rivera, a spokesperson for the Green Future Foundation. \"This could be a game-changer in our fight against climate change.\""

Then the Mediterranean Shipping Company began building two LNG carriers from US steel, Maersk Line set sail with an LNG vessel, and Prince Regent Shipping recruited additional capacity from sister company Carib Norway.\nIt was no surprise, then, that within three years the area had become the largest US export trade corridor, accounting for more than 80 per cent of the country\u2019s LNG shipments. \u201cWhat you saw was an interesting interplay between two supply channels and two export routes,\u201d says Myles McCormick, BP\u2019s chief commercial officer.\nThere are no such signs today. The Gulf of Mexico is the world\u2019s largest gathering point for gas from Canadian shale fields, accounting for more than a quarter of US natural gas exports. \u201cIt\u2019s an awfully powerful story and one that\u2019s getting global attention,\u201d says a senior oil industry executive.\nThe migration of US LNG supplies abroad is a foregone conclusion. Much of it will be driven by the need for cleaner fuels, notably propane and butane, used in US motor vehicles. That means utilities, which are also regional power generators, will drive demand for the US product.\nAs a result, trade flows are broadening to incorporate more product at terminals across the Gulf Coast. That includes products from British Columbia and Canada\u2019s western territories.\nNG Southern onshore infrastructure by volume US onshore processing is ahead of exports, says the Deloitte report\nGrowing use of shale gas as an alternative to dirtier fuels like coal and petcoke should free up more fuel for power generation, sparking further demand for exports. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve freed up the gas to be used for electricity generation, you\u2019re pushing that gas to the export market,\u201d says the oil executive.\nGiven this shift, energy companies are keen to develop more capacity to feed the flows. \u201cThe country has a lot of capacity coming on now in the utility sector,\u201d says one energy investor. \u201cCompanies are getting that ready for export.\u201d\nOnly one of two proposed export terminals has come onstream, near Corpus Christi, Texas. But the first three exports were brought onstream in June and August of this year at the Sabine Pass and Quintana Island facilities. All three terminals received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on August 16 and will ship to Japan, the top buyer of US gas.\nThose plants will each export 1.5m tons per year. That compares with 25m tons a year forecast for exports from the second.\nThe figure illustrates just how much gas has turned the region into a giant infrastructure project. With nearly 500 offshore platforms in use, about 38m barrels of oil and 140bn cubic feet of gas are produced every day from Texas alone. The US shale plays will be responsible for a third of US natural gas production through to 2020, according to a Deloitte study.\nAmong other changes:\nFirms have started building pipelines and storage regasification plants to fill coastal terminals that will be used to connect the two export markets.\nThere are plans to revamp and expand existing terminals, including Dominion\u2019s $9bn Cove Point terminal near Baltimore.\nThe result is a surge in applications for approval to build new terminals and to expand other existing terminals."

        "text": "Monica Lewinsky has called for elected officials to be subject to mandatory retirement ages and for presidential self-pardons to be banned. The former Bill Clinton White House intern whose affair with the president eventually set the stage for his 1998 impeachment pushed for those measures in an opinion piece published on Monday by Vanity Fair. Lewinsky, a political activist and writer, said that her editorial was inspired by recent discussions about whether the US constitution’s 14th amendment barred anyone from holding public office if they engage in an insurrection. Though she did not name him, days earlier, Donald Trump moved to appeal a Colorado court ruling that found the former president engaged in insurrection through his incitement of his supporters’ January 6 attack but nevertheless could not be disqualified from seeking the Oval Office again in 2024. Lewinsky said it was “bonkers” that the 14th amendment – which is otherwise known for extending equal protection under the law to all people within the US – “is the only place that addresses the disqualification of a candidate for such behavior”. “How. Is. This. Possible? Why don’t we have more protections?” Lewinsky wrote in Monday’s piece, in which she described herself as “a constitutional nerd” who then began researching amendments. She said she was surprised to learn that Congress passed the 27th and most recent constitutional amendment in only 1992. To her, the change was unimpressive – it clarified that proposed congressional raises could not take effect until the following legislative term. But she later realized that in the century before the so-called compensation amendment, Congress added changes to the constitution “every 10 to 20 years or so”. She said this prompted her to conclude: “It’s time. We are overdue for some constitutional upgrades.” Topping the list of a half-dozen proposed amendments, Lewinsky’s piece goes on to offer is an explicit ban against presidential self-pardons. Trump is facing more than 90 pending criminal charges for subversion of the 2020 election he lost to Joe Biden, retention of government secrets after his presidency and sending hush-money payments to the porn actor Stormy Daniels. Though it is an untested legal idea, Trump in theory could pardon himself if he has already been convicted of any crimes and re-elected. “Our constitution is not a game of Monopoly,” Lewinsky wrote. “For the head of the executive branch, there should not be a ‘get out of jail free’ card.” Lower in Lewinsky’s piece but still prominently mentioned is an idea to implement both term limits and a maximum age of service for elected officeholders. She justified her argument in part by noting that there are minimum ages for US House members, senators and presidents – 25, 30 and 35, respectively. “There are arguments to be made for experience,” Lewinsky wrote while alluding to the advanced ages of Trump (77) and Biden (81). “But for elected officials there is a point at which such qualifications risk being overshadowed by mental calcification and cultural deafness.” Other Lewinsky-suggested amendments would abandon the electoral college system, which decides presidential elections instead of a popular vote, and an amendment reasserting women’s reproductive freedoms after the US supreme court in 2022 overturned Roe v Wade. Clinton faced impeachment after lying about the affair he and Lewinsky had when he was 49 and she was 22. The Senate acquitted Clinton. Lewinsky has since earned a master’s degree from the London School of Economics and worked to combat cyberbullying. She has spoken about how she was publicly demonized and humiliated during the scandal that enveloped Clinton’s impeachment, saying she did not have the same power and influence that protected the then-president. “I felt like every layer of my skin and my identity were ripped off of me in 1998 and 1999,” she told the Guardian in 2016. “It’s a skinning of sorts … the shame sticks to you like tar.”"

        "text": "Working at a clip only slightly faster than usual, a team of professional songwriters spent a half hour banging out a new song that will define local teenager Destiny Cibula’s personality for the next two years, sources reported Thursday. “All right, let’s wrap this one up and get to lunch,” a 47-year-old Swedish producer said of the future chart-topper that features a chorus written in 20 seconds and that will prove formative to Cibula’s adolescence, changing the way she sees herself and, years later, encapsulating more than anything else the nostalgia she feels for her youth. “Keep it simple—hit the root, the fourth, the fifth. There we go. ‘You’re a bird, spread your wings, blah blah blah.’ Just copy and paste the beat from whatever worked last time, as long as it’s something you can dance to at a wedding. And hurry up, I have a one o’clock reservation.” At press time, the songwriters had reportedly returned from lunch and were already putting the finishing touches on another song, this one a down-tempo number that a ninth-grade Cibula will play on repeat for hours after going through her first breakup."

        "text": "A NASA spacecraft has entered a previously unexplored region of the Solar System — the Sun’s outer atmosphere, or corona. The long-awaited milestone, which was reached in April but announced on 14 December, is a major accomplishment for the Parker Solar Probe, a craft that is flying closer to the Sun than any mission in history.\n“We have finally arrived,” said Nicola Fox, director of NASA’s heliophysics division, located at the agency’s headquarters in Washington DC. “Humanity has touched the Sun.”\nShe and other team members spoke during a press conference at this week’s American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana. A paper describing the findings appears this week in Physical Review Letters1.\nIn many ways, the Parker Solar Probe is a counterpoint to NASA’s twin Voyager spacecraft. In 2012, Voyager 1 travelled so far from the Sun that it became the first mission to leave the region of space dominated by the solar wind — the energetic flood of particles coming from the Sun. By contrast, the Parker probe is travelling ever closer to the heart of the Solar System, flying head-on into the solar wind and our star’s atmosphere. With this new front-row seat, scientists can explore some of the biggest unanswered questions about the Sun, such as how it generates the solar wind and how its corona gets heated to temperatures more extreme than those on the Sun’s surface.\n“This is a huge milestone,” says Craig DeForest, a solar physicist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, who is not involved in the mission. Flying into the solar corona represents “one of the last great unknowns”, he says.\nThe Parker probe crossed into the Sun’s atmosphere at 09:33 universal time on 28 April. Mission scientists needed several months to download and analyse the data the spacecraft had collected, and to be sure that it had indeed crossed the much-anticipated boundary, known as the Alfvén surface.\nThis surface marks the interface between the Sun’s atmosphere and an outer region of space dominated by the solar wind. Swedish physicist Hannes Alfvén proposed the underlying theory behind the boundary in a paper published in Nature in 19422, and scientists have been looking for it ever since.\nBut it took the US$1.5-billion Parker Solar Probe to finally get there. Since its launch in 2018, it has been orbiting the Sun: with each pass, it loops ever closer to the solar surface. A carbon-composite heat shield protects its instruments from temperatures that will eventually soar to 1,370 °C.\nThe spacecraft crossed the Alfvén boundary when it was around 14 million kilometres, or just under 20 solar radii, from the Sun’s surface. That’s about where team members had expected to find the interface, says Nour Raouafi, the mission’s project scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.\nSome researchers had speculated that the boundary would be rather ‘fuzzy’ — but, instead, it was sharp and wrinkly. The spacecraft’s trajectory took it into the corona for nearly five hours and then back out; and it might have briefly crossed into the corona twice more. Inside the corona, the solar wind speed and plasma densities dropped, suggesting the boundary had indeed been crossed. “We are learning new things that we did not have access to before,” Raouafi says.\nAs it crossed the Alfvén surface, the Parker probe flew through a ‘pseudostreamer’ of electrically charged material, inside which conditions were quieter than the roiling environment outside of it. While inside the corona, the spacecraft also studied unusual kinks in the magnetic field of the solar wind, known as switchbacks. Scientists already knew about switchbacks, but the probe’s data have enabled the researchers to trace where the switchbacks come from, all the way down to the solar surface.\nKnowing how such features form on the Sun, and how they influence the solar wind and other eruptions of charged particles, will help people on Earth to prepare for disruptive space weather, such as solar storms that can knock out satellite communications. The discoveries will also help researchers to understand the forces that power stars other than the Sun, said Kelly Korreck, a solar physicist at NASA’s headquarters, at the press conference.\nThe Parker Solar Probe ultimately aims to make 24 close passes of the Sun. It crossed the Alfvén surface on the eighth of those fly-bys, and might have done so again during its ninth pass in November — a manoeuvre for which the data have not yet been fully downloaded and analysed. The mission’s closest approach is scheduled for 2025, when it will be only 6.2 million kilometres from the solar surface, well within the orbit of Mercury. Each visit will continue to reveal new information about processes in the corona, said Justin Kasper, a solar physicist and deputy chief technology officer at BWX Technologies in Washington DC, who works on the Parker probe.\n“Being this close to the Sun is allowing us to make really interesting and new connections we wouldn’t be able to do from afar,” he said.\n"

        "text": "Noting that educators in Mississippi who are trying to get a growth mindset \u2014 the belief that it is okay for students to push themselves to their limits and often learn to avoid backing down \u2014 are much more successful than educators elsewhere, Stanford University education professor Carol Dweck said, \u201cWe\u2019re teaching (misuse) in education in terms of motivation, rather than teaching growth. We\u2019re shooting ourselves in the foot.\u201d\nDweck\u2019s comments came Nov. 18 as part of the \u201cDay of Action for Mindsets\u201d and a Q&A session at the Faculty Club during a daylong gathering organized by Michigan State University (MSU). MSU professor John Burke opened the forum by taking on the idea that growth mindset might be a \u201cchick lit\u201d idea or a trendy self-help philosophy.\n\u201cI think you may end up being wrong about this and teach growth,\u201d Burke said.\nDweck is not a content adviser to the educational consulting firm Ileana\u2019s Company, which sponsored the forum with Penn State, but had been invited to the event to speak. Ileana Tande, president of Penn State\u2019s Center for Mindset Collaboration and author of several books on the subject, welcomed Dweck, telling her about some of the progress the university had made in the last several years.\nThe point, she said, was \u201cto break through the blockage for growth mindset in education.\u201d\nDweck, who authored \u201cMindset\u201d in 2010, was asked a follow-up question about the topic that she also addressed in her 2010 book.\n\u201cOne of the things that I never understood about growth mindset is why we go so far in the opposite direction in growth when it seems like so much of growth is about resisting, not cooperating,\u201d Burke said. \u201cIt seems like it would be rather annoying, actually, for students to push themselves at their own cost. They\u2019d be telling them to sit at home, be lazy, work from home.\u201d\nThe problem, Dweck said, is that many people across the nation learn in a culture that makes it acceptable to back down or reach for the easy path.\n\u201cWe\u2019re fighting against that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a culture where we\u2019re not thinking about resisting. It\u2019s a culture where we consider the kid who\u2019s pushing themselves so much easier to teach.\u201d\nFor this reason, a growth mindset campaign is spreading rapidly in education. Currently, eight states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia, require students to complete at least 20 days of growth mindset training. The efforts of such growth mindset groups have been included in legislation being passed in several other states, including California, Illinois, Kentucky, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Ohio.\nThe schools that have seen the most success are three small Mississippi-based charter schools, one of which, the John W. Lee Community School in Gary, just off Interstate 80, is seeking state approval to expand to accept more students.\n\u201cYou see that optimism in the classroom,\u201d said Cody Lee, who teaches elementary math at the John W. Lee School.\nThe district is the result of a collaboration between the Gary Community School Corp. and Lamar Advertising Co. after the company bought into the Gary school district in 1999. Lee said he believes in growth mindset and believes students learn best when they push themselves.\n\u201cIf you want to raise kids that are going to make a difference in the world, give them opportunity and don\u2019t hold them back,\u201d he said.\nKelly Smith, whose son attended the John W. Lee School, said she worked with teachers there to emphasize the importance of failure.\n\u201cWe let them fail and they struggle with those failures, but then we let them learn and work through it,\u201d Smith said. \u201cJust be in the moment. They need those experiences to be able to excel.\u201d\n"
